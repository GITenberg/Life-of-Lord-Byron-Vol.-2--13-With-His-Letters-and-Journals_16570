<p>Having landed the young pilgrim once more in England, it may be worth
while, before we accompany him into the scenes that awaited him at home,
to consider how far the general character of his mind and disposition
may have been affected by the course of travel and adventure, in which
he had been, for the last two years, engaged. A life less savouring of
poetry and romance than that which he had pursued previously to his
departure on his travels, it would be difficult to imagine. In his
childhood, it is true, he had been a dweller and wanderer among scenes
well calculated, according to the ordinary notion, to implant the first
rudiments of poetic feeling. But, though the poet may afterwards feed on
the recollection of such scenes, it is more than questionable, as has
been already observed, whether he ever has been formed by them. If a
childhood, indeed, passed among mountainous scenery were so favourable
to the awakening of the imaginative power, both the Welsh, among
ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>Pg 2</span> and the Swiss, abroad, ought to rank much higher on the
scale of poetic excellence than they do at present. But, even allowing
the picturesqueness of his early haunts to have had some share in giving
a direction to the fancy of Byron, the actual operation of this
influence, whatever it may have been, ceased with his childhood; and the
life which he led afterwards during his school-days at Harrow, was,&mdash;as
naturally the life of so idle and daring a schoolboy must be,&mdash;the very
reverse of poetical. For a soldier or an adventurer, the course of
training through which he then passed would have been perfect;&mdash;his
athletic sports, his battles, his love of dangerous enterprise, gave
every promise of a spirit fit for the most stormy career. But to the
meditative pursuits of poesy, these dispositions seemed, of all others,
the least friendly; and, however they might promise to render him, at
some future time, a subject for bards, gave, assuredly, but little hope
of his shining first among bards himself.</p>

<p>The habits of his life at the university were even still less
intellectual and literary. While a schoolboy, he had read abundantly and
eagerly, though desultorily; but even this discipline of his mind,
irregular and undirected as it was, he had, in a great measure, given
up, after leaving Harrow; and among the pursuits that occupied his
academic hours, those of playing at hazard, sparring, and keeping a bear
and bull-dogs, were, if not the most favourite, at least, perhaps, the
most innocent. His time in London passed equally unmarked either by
mental cultivation or refined amusement. Having<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>Pg 3</span> no resources in private
society, from his total want of friends and connections, he was left to
live loosely about town among the loungers in coffee-houses; and to
those who remember what his two favourite haunts, Limmer's and
Stevens's, were at that period, it is needless to say that, whatever
else may have been the merits of these establishments, they were
anything but fit schools for the formation of poetic character.</p>

<p>But however incompatible such a life must have been with those habits of
contemplation, by which, and which only, the faculties he had already
displayed could be ripened, or those that were still latent could be
unfolded, yet, in another point of view, the time now apparently
squandered by him, was, in after-days, turned most invaluably to
account. By thus initiating him into a knowledge of the varieties of
human character,&mdash;by giving him an insight into the details of society,
in their least artificial form,&mdash;in short, by mixing him up, thus early,
with the world, its business and its pleasures, his London life but
contributed its share in forming that wonderful combination which his
mind afterwards exhibited, of the imaginative and the practical&mdash;the
heroic and the humorous&mdash;of the keenest and most dissecting views of
real life, with the grandest and most spiritualised conceptions of ideal
grandeur.</p>

<p>To the same period, perhaps, another predominant characteristic of his
maturer mind and writings may be traced. In this anticipated experience
of the world which his early mixture with its crowd gave him, it is but
little probable that many of the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>Pg 4</span> favourable specimens of human
kind should have fallen under his notice. On the contrary, it is but too
likely that some of the lightest and least estimable of both sexes may
have been among the models, on which, at an age when impressions sink
deepest, his earliest judgments of human nature were formed. Hence,
probably, those contemptuous and debasing views of humanity with which
he was so often led to alloy his noblest tributes to the loveliness and
majesty of general nature. Hence the contrast that appeared between the
fruits of his imagination and of his experience,&mdash;between those dreams,
full of beauty and kindliness, with which the one teemed at his bidding,
and the dark, desolating bitterness that overflowed when he drew from
the other.</p>

<p>Unpromising, however, as was his youth of the high destiny that awaited
him, there was one unfailing characteristic of the imaginative order of
minds&mdash;his love of solitude&mdash;which very early gave signs of those habits
of self-study and introspection by which alone the "diamond quarries" of
genius are worked and brought to light. When but a boy, at Harrow, he
had shown this disposition strongly,&mdash;being often known, as I have
already mentioned, to withdraw himself from his playmates, and sitting
alone upon a tomb in the churchyard, give himself up, for hours, to
thought. As his mind began to disclose its resources, this feeling grew
upon him; and, had his foreign travel done no more than, by detaching
him from the distractions of society, to enable him, solitarily and
freely, to commune with his own spirit, it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>Pg 5</span> an
all-important step gained towards the full expansion of his faculties.
It was only then, indeed, that he began to feel himself capable of the
abstraction which self-study requires, or to enjoy that freedom from the
intrusion of others' thoughts, which alone leaves the contemplative mind
master of its own. In the solitude of his nights at sea, in his lone
wanderings through Greece, he had sufficient leisure and seclusion to
look within himself, and there catch the first "glimpses of his glorious
mind." One of his chief delights, as he mentioned in his "Memoranda,"
was, when bathing in some retired spot, to seat himself on a high rock
above the sea, and there remain for hours, gazing upon the sky and the
waters<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and lost in that sort of vague reverie, which, however
formless and indistinct at the moment, settled afterwards on his pages,
into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>Pg 6</span> those clear, bright pictures which will endure for ever.</p>

<p>Were it not for the doubt and diffidence that hang round the first steps
of genius, this growing consciousness of his own power, these openings
into a new domain of intellect, where he was to reign supreme, must have
made the solitary hours of the young traveller one dream of happiness.
But it will be seen that, even yet, he distrusted his own strength, nor
was at all aware of the height to which the spirit he was now calling up
would grow. So enamoured, nevertheless, had he become of these lonely
musings, that even the society of his fellow-traveller, though with
pursuits so congenial to his own, grew at last to be a chain and a
burden on him; and it was not till he stood, companionless, on the shore
of the little island in the Aegean, that he found his spirit breathe
freely. If any stronger proof were wanting of his deep passion for
solitude, we shall find it, not many years after, in his own written
avowal, that, even when in the company of the woman he most loved, he
not unfrequently found himself sighing to be alone.</p>

<p>It was not only, however, by affording him the concentration necessary
for this silent drawing out of his feelings and powers, that travel
conduced so essentially to the formation of his poetical character. To
the East he had looked, with the eyes of romance, from his very
childhood. Before he was ten years of age, the perusal of Rycaut's
History of the Turks had taken a strong hold of his imagination, and he
read eagerly, in consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>Pg 7</span> every book concerning the East he could
find.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In visiting, therefore, those countries, he was but realising
the dreams of his childhood; and this return of his thoughts to that
innocent time, gave a freshness and purity to their current which they
had long wanted. Under the spell of such recollections, the attraction
of novelty was among the least that the scenes, through which he
wandered, presented. Fond traces of the past&mdash;and few have ever retained
them so vividly&mdash;mingled themselves with the impressions of the objects
before him; and as, among the Highlands, he had often<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>Pg 8</span> traversed, in
fancy, the land of the Moslem, so memory, from the wild hills of
Albania, now "carried him back to Morven."</p>

<p>While such sources of poetic feeling were stirred at every step, there
was also in his quick change of place and scene&mdash;in the diversity of men
and manners surveyed by him&mdash;in the perpetual hope of adventure and
thirst of enterprise, such a succession and variety of ever fresh
excitement as not only brought into play, but invigorated, all the
energies of his character: as he, himself, describes his mode of living,
it was "To-day in a palace, to-morrow in a cow-house&mdash;this day with the
Pacha, the next with a shepherd." Thus were his powers of observation
quickened, and the impressions on his imagination multiplied. Thus
schooled, too, in some of the roughnesses and privations of life, and,
so far, made acquainted with the flavour of adversity, he learned to
enlarge, more than is common in his high station, the circle of his
sympathies, and became inured to that manly and vigorous cast of thought
which is so impressed on all his writings. Nor must we forget, among
these strengthening and animating effects of travel, the ennobling
excitement of danger, which he more than once experienced,&mdash;having been
placed in situations, both on land and sea, well calculated to call
forth that pleasurable sense of energy, which perils, calmly confronted,
never fail to inspire.</p>

<p>The strong interest which&mdash;in spite of his assumed philosophy on this
subject in Childe Harold&mdash;he took in every thing connected with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>Pg 9</span> life
of warfare, found frequent opportunities of gratification, not only on
board the English ships of war in which he sailed, but in his occasional
intercourse with the soldiers of the country. At Salora, a solitary
place on the Gulf of Arta, he once passed two or three days, lodged in a
small miserable barrack. Here, he lived the whole time, familiarly,
among the soldiers; and a picture of the singular scene which their
evenings presented&mdash;of those wild, half-bandit warriors, seated round
the young poet, and examining with savage admiration his fine Manton
gun<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and English sword&mdash;might be contrasted, but too touchingly, with
another and a later picture of the same poet, dying, as a chieftain, on
the same land, with Suliotes for his guards, and all Greece for his
mourners.</p>

<p>It is true, amidst all this stimulating variety of objects, the
melancholy which he had brought from home still lingered around his
mind. To Mr. Adair and Mr. Bruce, as I have before mentioned, he gave
the idea of a person labouring under deep dejection; and Colonel Leake,
who was, at that time, resident at Ioannina, conceived very much the
same impression of the state of his mind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>Pg 10</span> But, assuredly, even this
melancholy, habitually as it still clung to him, must, under the
stirring and healthful influences of his roving life, have become a far
more elevated and abstract feeling than it ever could have expanded to
within reach of those annoyances, whose tendency was to keep it wholly
concentrated round self. Had he remained idly at home, he would have
sunk, perhaps, into a querulous satirist. But, as his views opened on a
freer and wider horizon, every feeling of his nature kept pace with
their enlargement; and this inborn sadness, mingling itself with the
effusions of his genius, became one of the chief constituent charms not
only of their pathos, but their grandeur. For, when did ever a sublime
thought spring up in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>Pg 11</span> soul, that melancholy was not to be found,
however latent, in its neighbourhood?</p>

<p>We have seen, from the letters written by him on his passage homeward,
how far from cheerful or happy was the state of mind in which he
returned. In truth, even for a disposition of the most sanguine cast,
there was quite enough in the discomforts that now awaited him in
England, to sadden its hopes, and check its buoyancy. "To be happy at
home," says Johnson, "is the ultimate result of all ambition, the end to
which every enterprise and labour tends." But Lord Byron had no
home,&mdash;at least none that deserved this endearing name. A fond family
circle, to accompany him with its prayers, while away, and draw round
him, with listening eagerness, on his return, was what, unluckily, he
never knew, though with a heart, as we have seen, by nature formed for
it. In the absence, too, of all that might cheer and sustain, he had
every thing to encounter that could distress and humiliate. To the
dreariness of a home without affection, was added the burden of an
establishment without means; and he had thus all the embarrassments of
domestic life, without its charms. His affairs had, during his absence,
been suffered to fall into confusion, even greater than their inherent
tendency to such a state warranted. There had been, the preceding year,
an execution on Newstead, for a debt of 1500<i>l.</i> owing to the Messrs.
Brothers, upholsterers; and a circumstance told of the veteran, Joe
Murray, on this occasion, well deserves to be mentioned. To this
faithful old servant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>Pg 12</span> jealous of the ancient honour of the Byrons, the
sight of the notice of sale, pasted up on the abbey-door, could not be
otherwise than an unsightly and intolerable nuisance. Having enough,
however, of the fear of the law before his eyes, not to tear the writing
down, he was at last forced, as his only consolatory expedient, to paste
a large piece of brown paper over it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the resolution, so recently expressed by Lord Byron, to
abandon for ever the vocation of authorship, and leave "the whole
Castalian state" to others, he was hardly landed in England when we find
him busily engaged in preparations for the publication of some of the
poems which he had produced abroad. So eager was he, indeed, to print,
that he had already, in a letter written at sea, announced himself to
Mr. Dallas, as ready for the press. Of this letter, which, from its
date, ought to have preceded some of the others that have been given, I
shall here lay before the reader the most material parts.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 54. TO MR. DALLAS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>"Volage Frigate, at sea, June 28. 1811</i>.</p>

<p>"After two years' absence, (to a day, on the 2d of July, before
which we shall not arrive at Portsmouth,) I am retracing my way to
England.</p>

<p>"I am coming back with little prospect of pleasure at home, and
with a body a little shaken by one or two smart fevers, but a
spirit I hope yet unbroken. My affairs, it seems, are considerably
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>Pg 13</span>volved, and much business must be done with lawyers, colliers,
farmers, and creditors. Now this, to a man who hates bustle as he
hates a bishop, is a serious concern. But enough of my home
department.</p>

<p>"My Satire, it seems, is in a fourth edition, a success rather
above the middling run, but not much for a production which, from
its topics, must be temporary, and of course be successful at
first, or not at all. At this period, when I can think and act more
coolly, I regret that I have written it, though I shall probably
find it forgotten by all except those whom it has offended.</p>

<p>"Yours and Pratt's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, Blackett, the cobbler, is dead, in
spite of his rhymes, and is probably one of the instances where
death has saved a man from damnation. You were the ruin of that
poor fellow amongst you: had it not been for his patrons, he might
now have been in very good plight, shoe-(not verse-) making: but
you have made him immortal with a vengeance. I write this,
supposing poetry, patronage, and strong waters, to have been the
death of him. If you are in town in or about the beginning of July,
you will find me at Dorant's, in Albemarle Street, glad to see you.
I have an imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry ready for Cawthorn,
but don't let that deter you, for I sha'n't inflict it upon you.
You know I never read my rhymes to visitors. I shall quit town in a
few days for Notts., and thence to Rochdale.</p>

<p>"Yours, &amp;c."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Immediately, on Lord Byron's arrival in London,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>Pg 14</span> Mr. Dallas called upon
him. "On the 15th of July," says this gentleman, "I had the pleasure of
shaking hands with him at Reddish's Hotel in St. James's Street. I
thought his looks belied the report he had given me of his bodily
health, and his countenance did not betoken melancholy, or displeasure
at his return. He was very animated in the account of his travels, but
assured me he had never had the least idea of writing them. He said he
believed satire to be his <i>forte</i>, and to that he had adhered, having
written, during his stay at different places abroad, a Paraphrase of
Horace's Art of Poetry, which would be a good finish to English Bards
and Scotch Reviewers. He seemed to promise himself additional fame from
it, and I undertook to superintend its publication, as I had done that
of the Satire. I had chosen the time ill for my visit, and we had hardly
any time to converse uninterruptedly, he therefore engaged me to
breakfast with him next morning."</p>

<p>In the interval Mr. Dallas looked over this Paraphrase, which he had
been permitted by Lord Byron to take home with him for the purpose, and
his disappointment was, as he himself describes it, "grievous," on
finding, that a pilgrimage of two years to the inspiring lands of the
East had been attended with no richer poetical result. On their meeting
again next morning, though unwilling to speak disparagingly of the work,
he could not refrain, as he informs us, from expressing some surprise
that his noble friend should have produced nothing else during his
absence.&mdash;"Upon this," he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>Pg 15</span> continues, "Lord Byron told me that he had
occasionally written short poems, besides a great many stanzas in
Spenser's measure, relative to the countries he had visited. 'They are
not worth troubling you with, but you shall have them all with you if
you like.' So came I by Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. He took it from a
small trunk, with a number of verses. He said they had been read but by
one person, who had found very little to commend and much to condemn:
that he himself was of that opinion, and he was sure I should be so too.
Such as it was, however, it was at my service; but he was urgent that
'The Hints from Horace' should be immediately put in train, which I
promised to have done."</p>

<p>The value of the treasure thus presented to him, Mr. Dallas was not slow
in discovering. That very evening he despatched a letter to his noble
friend, saying&mdash;"You have written one of the most delightful poems I
ever read. If I wrote this in flattery, I should deserve your contempt
rather than your friendship. I have been so fascinated with Childe
Harold that I have not been able to lay it down. I would almost pledge
my life on its advancing the reputation of your poetical powers, and on
its gaining you great honour and regard, if you will do me the credit
and favour of attending to my suggestions respecting," &amp;c.&amp;c.&amp;c.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this just praise, and the secret echo it must have found
in a heart so awake to the slightest whisper of fame, it was some time
before<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>Pg 16</span> Lord Byron's obstinate repugnance to the idea of publishing
Childe Harold could be removed.</p>

<p>"Attentive," says Mr. Dallas, "as he had hitherto been to my opinions
and suggestions, and natural as it was that he should be swayed by such
decided praise, I was surprised to find that I could not at first obtain
credit with him for my judgment on Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. 'It was
any thing but poetry&mdash;it had been condemned by a good critic&mdash;had I not
myself seen the sentences on the margins of the manuscripts?' He dwelt
upon the Paraphrase of the Art of Poetry with pleasure, and the
manuscript of that was given to Cawthorn, the publisher of the Satire,
to be brought forth without delay. I did not, however, leave him so:
before I quitted him I returned to the charge, and told him that I was
so convinced of the merit of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, that, as he had
given it to me, I should certainly publish it, if he would have the
kindness to attend to some corrections and alterations."</p>

<p>Among the many instances, recorded in literary history, of the false
judgments of authors respecting their own productions, the preference
given by Lord Byron to a work so little worthy of his genius, over a
poem of such rare and original beauty as the first Cantos of Childe
Harold, may be accounted, perhaps, one of the most extraordinary and
inexplicable.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>Pg 17</span></p>

<p>"It is in men as in soils," says Swift, "where sometimes there is a vein
of gold which the owner knows not of." But Lord Byron had made the
discovery of the vein, without, as it would seem, being aware of its
value. I have already had occasion to observe that, even while occupied
with the composition of Childe Harold, it is questionable whether he
himself was yet fully conscious of the new powers, both of thought and
feeling, that had been awakened in him; and the strange estimate we now
find him forming of his own production appears to warrant the remark. It
would seem, indeed, as if, while the imaginative powers of his mind had
received such an impulse forward, the faculty of judgment, slower in its
developement, was still immature, and that of <i>self</i>-judgment, the most
difficult of all, still unattained.</p>

<p>On the other hand, from the deference which, particularly at this period
of his life, he was inclined to pay to the opinions of those with whom
he associated, it would be fairer, perhaps, to conclude that this
erroneous valuation arose rather from a diffidence in his own judgment
than from any deficiency of it. To his college companions, almost all of
whom were his superiors in scholarship, and some of them even, at this
time, his competitors in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>Pg 18</span> poetry, he looked up with a degree of fond and
admiring deference, for which his ignorance of his own intellectual
strength alone could account; and the example, as well as tastes, of
these young writers being mostly on the side of established models,
their authority, as long as it influenced him, would, to a certain
degree, interfere with his striking confidently into any new or original
path. That some remains of this bias, with a little leaning, perhaps,
towards school recollections<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, may have had a share in prompting his
preference of the Horatian Paraphrase, is by no means improbable;&mdash;at
least, that it was enough to lead him, untried as he had yet been in the
new path, to content himself, for the present, with following up his
success in the old. We have seen, indeed, that the manuscript of the two
Cantos of Childe Harold had, previously to its being placed in the hands
of Mr. Dallas, been submitted by the noble author to the perusal of some
friend&mdash;the first and only one, it appears, who at that time had seen
them. Who this fastidious critic was, Mr. Dallas has not mentioned; but
the sweeping tone of censure in which he conveyed his remarks was such
as, at any period of his career,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>Pg 19</span> would have disconcerted the judgment
of one, who, years after, in all the plenitude of his fame, confessed,
that "the depreciation of the lowest of mankind was more painful to him
than the applause of the highest was pleasing."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Though on every thing that, after his arrival at the age of manhood, he
produced, some mark or other of the master-hand may be traced; yet, to
print the whole of his Paraphrase of Horace, which extends to nearly 800
lines, would be, at the best, but a questionable compliment to his
memory. That the reader, however, may be enabled to form some opinion of
a performance, which&mdash;by an error or caprice of judgment, unexampled,
perhaps, in the annals of literature&mdash;its author, for a time, preferred
to the sublime musings of Childe Harold, I shall here select a few such
passages from the Paraphrase as may seem calculated to give an idea as
well of its merits as its defects.</p>

notion of the remainder, which is, for the most part, of a very inferior

<p>In tracing the fortunes of men, it is not a little curious to observe,
how often the course of a whole life has depended on one single step.
Had Lord Byron now persisted in his original purpose of giving this poem
to the press, instead of Childe Harold, it is more than probable that he
would have been lost, as a great poet, to the world.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Inferior as the
Paraphrase is, in every respect, to his former Satire, and, in some
places, even descending below the level of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>Pg 28</span> under-graduate versifiers,
its failure, there can be little doubt, would have been certain and
signal;&mdash;his former assailants would have resumed their advantage over
him, and either, in the bitterness of his mortification, he would have
flung Childe Harold into the fire; or, had he summoned up sufficient
confidence to publish that poem, its reception, even if sufficient to
retrieve him in the eyes of the public and his own, could never have, at
all, resembled that explosion of success,&mdash;that instantaneous and
universal acclaim of admiration into which, coming, as it were, fresh
from the land of song, he now surprised the world, and in the midst of
which he was borne, buoyant and self-assured, along, through a
succession of new triumphs, each more splendid than the last.</p>

<p>Happily, the better judgment of his friends averted such a risk; and he
at length consented to the immediate publication of Childe
Harold,&mdash;still, however, to the last, expressing his doubts of its
merits, and his alarm at the sort of reception it might meet with in the
world.</p>

<p>"I did all I could," says his adviser, "to raise his opinion of this
composition, and I succeeded; but he varied much in his feelings about
it, nor was he, as will appear, at his ease until the world decided on
its merit. He said again and again that I was going to get him into a
scrape with his old enemies, and that none of them would rejoice more
than the Edinburgh Reviewers at an opportunity to humble him. He said I
must not put his name<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>Pg 29</span> to it. I entreated him to leave it to me, and
that I would answer for this poem silencing all his enemies."</p>

<p>The publication being now determined upon, there arose some doubts and
difficulty as to a publisher. Though Lord Byron had intrusted Cawthorn
with what he considered to be his surer card, the "Hints from Horace,"
he did not, it seems, think him of sufficient station in the trade to
give a sanction or fashion to his more hazardous experiment. The former
refusal of the Messrs. Longman<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to publish his "English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers" was not forgotten; and he expressly stipulated with
Mr. Dallas that the manuscript should not be offered to that house. An
application was, at first, made to Mr. Miller, of Albemarle Street; but,
in consequence of the severity with which Lord Elgin was treated in the
poem, Mr. Miller (already the publisher and bookseller of this latter
nobleman) declined the work. Even this circumstance,&mdash;so apprehensive
was the poet for his fame,&mdash;began to re-awaken all the qualms and
terrors he had, at first, felt; and, had any further difficulties or
objections arisen, it is more than probable he might have relapsed into
his original intention. It was not long, however, before a person was
found willing and proud to undertake the publication.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>Pg 30</span> Mr. Murray, who,
at this period, resided in Fleet Street, having, some time before,
expressed a desire to be allowed to publish some work of Lord Byron, it
was in his hands that Mr. Dallas now placed the manuscript of Childe
Harold;&mdash;and thus was laid the first foundation of that connection
between this gentleman and the noble poet, which continued, with but a
temporary interruption, throughout the lifetime of the one, and has
proved an abundant source of honour, as well as emolument, to the other.</p>

<p>While thus busily engaged in his literary projects, and having, besides,
some law affairs to transact with his agent, he was called suddenly away
to Newstead by the intelligence of an event which seems to have affected
his mind far more deeply than, considering all the circumstances of the
case, could have been expected. Mrs. Byron, whose excessive corpulence
rendered her, at all times, rather a perilous subject for illness, had
been of late indisposed, but not to any alarming degree; nor does it
appear that, when the following note was written, there existed any
grounds for apprehension as to her state.</p>

to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>Pg 31</span> Lancashire on Rochdale business. I shall attend to your
directions, of course, and am,</p>

<p>"With great respect, yours ever,"</p>

<p>"BYRON.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;You will consider Newstead as your house, not mine; and me
only as a visitor."</p></div>

<p>On his going abroad, she had conceived a sort of superstitious fancy
that she should never see him again; and when he returned, safe and
well, and wrote to inform her that he should soon see her at Newstead,
she said to her waiting-woman, "If I should be dead before Byron comes
down, what a strange thing it would be!"&mdash;and so, in fact, it happened.
At the end of July, her illness took a new and fatal turn; and, so sadly
characteristic was the close of the poor lady's life, that a fit of
rage, brought on, it is said, by reading over the upholsterer's bills,
was the ultimate cause of her death. Lord Byron had, of course, prompt
intelligence of the attack. But, though he started instantly from town,
he was too late,&mdash;she had breathed her last.</p>

<p>The following letter, it will be perceived, was written on his way to
Newstead.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 55. TO DR. PIGOT.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newport Pagnell, August 2. 1811.</p>

<p>"My dear Doctor,</p>

<p>"My poor mother died yesterday! and I am on my way from town to
attend her to the family vault. I heard <i>one</i> day of her illness,
the <i>next</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>Pg 32</span> her death. Thank God her last moments were most
tranquil. I am told she was in little pain, and not aware of her
situation. I now feel the truth of Mr. Gray's observation, 'That we
can only have <i>one</i> mother.' Peace be with her! I have to thank you
for your expressions of regard; and as in six weeks I shall be in
Lancashire on business, I may extend to Liverpool and Chester,&mdash;at
least I shall endeavour.</p>

<p>"If it will be any satisfaction, I have to inform you that in
November next the Editor of the Scourge will be tried for two
different libels on the late Mrs. B. and myself (the decease of
Mrs. B. makes no difference in the proceedings); and as he is
guilty, by his very foolish and unfounded assertion, of a breach of
privilege, he will be prosecuted with the utmost rigour.</p>

<p>"I inform you of this as you seem interested in the affair, which
is now in the hands of the Attorney-general.</p>

<p>"I shall remain at Newstead the greater part of this month, where I
shall be happy to hear from you, after my two years' absence in the
East.</p>

<p>"I am, dear Pigot, yours very truly,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It can hardly have escaped the observation of the reader, that the
general tone of the noble poet's correspondence with his mother is that
of a son, performing, strictly and conscientiously, what he deems to be
his duty, without the intermixture of any sentiment of cordiality to
sweeten the task.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>Pg 33</span> The very title of "Madam," by which he addresses
her,&mdash;and which he but seldom exchanges for the endearing name of
"mother<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,"&mdash;is, of itself, a sufficient proof of the sentiments he
entertained for her. That such should have been his dispositions towards
such a parent, can be matter neither of surprise or blame,&mdash;but that,
notwithstanding this alienation, which her own unfortunate temper
produced, he should have continued to consult her wishes, and minister
to her comforts, with such unfailing thoughtfulness as is evinced not
only in the frequency of his letters, but in the almost exclusive
appropriation of Newstead to her use, redounds, assuredly, in no
ordinary degree, to his honour; and was even the more strikingly
meritorious from the absence of that affection which renders kindnesses
to a beloved object little more than an indulgence of self.</p>

<p>But, however estranged from her his feelings must be allowed to have
been while she lived, her death seems to have restored them into their
natural channel. Whether from a return of early fondness and the
all-atoning power of the grave, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>Pg 34</span> from the prospect of that void in
his future life which this loss of his only link with the past would
leave, it is certain that he felt the death of his mother acutely, if
not deeply. On the night after his arrival at Newstead, the
waiting-woman of Mrs. Byron, in passing the door of the room where the
deceased lady lay, heard a sound as of some one sighing heavily from
within; and, on entering the chamber, found, to her surprise, Lord
Byron, sitting in the dark, beside the bed. On her representing to him
the weakness of thus giving way to grief, he burst into tears, and
exclaimed, "Oh, Mrs. By, I had but one friend in the world, and she is
gone!"</p>

<p>While his real thoughts were thus confided to silence and darkness,
there was, in other parts of his conduct more open to observation, a
degree of eccentricity and indecorum which, with superficial observers,
might well bring the sensibility of his nature into question. On the
morning of the funeral, having declined following the remains himself,
he stood looking, from the abbey door, at the procession, till the whole
had moved off;&mdash;then, turning to young Rushton, who was the only person
left besides himself, he desired him to fetch the sparring-gloves, and
proceeded to his usual exercise with the boy. He was silent and
abstracted all the time, and, as if from an effort to get the better of
his feelings, threw more violence, Rushton thought, into his blows than
was his habit; but, at last,&mdash;the struggle seeming too much for him,&mdash;he
flung away the gloves, and retired to his room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>Pg 35</span></p>

<p>Of Mrs. Byron, sufficient, perhaps, has been related in these pages to
enable the reader to form fully his own opinion, as well with respect to
the character of this lady herself, as to the degree of influence her
temper and conduct may have exercised on those of her son. It was said
by one of the most extraordinary of men<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>,&mdash;who was himself, as he
avowed, principally indebted to maternal culture for the unexampled
elevation to which he subsequently rose,&mdash;that "the future good or bad
conduct of a child depends entirely on the mother." How far the leaven
that sometimes mixed itself with the better nature of Byron,&mdash;his
uncertain and wayward impulses,&mdash;his defiance of restraint,&mdash;the
occasional bitterness of his hate, and the precipitance of his
resentments,&mdash;may have had their origin in his early collisions with
maternal caprice and violence, is an enquiry for which sufficient
materials have been, perhaps, furnished in these pages, but which every
one will decide upon, according to the more or less weight he may
attribute to the influence of such causes on the formation of character.</p>

<p>That, notwithstanding her injudicious and coarse treatment of him, Mrs.
Byron loved her son, with that sort of fitful fondness of which alone
such a nature is capable, there can be little doubt,&mdash;and still less,
that she was ambitiously proud of him. Her anxiety for the success of
his first literary essays may be collected from the pains which he so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>Pg 36</span>
considerately took to tranquillise her on the appearance of the hostile
article in the Review. As his fame began to brighten, that notion of his
future greatness and glory, which, by a singular forecast of
superstition, she had entertained from his very childhood, became
proportionably confirmed. Every mention of him in print was watched by
her with eagerness; and she had got bound together in a volume, which a
friend of mine once saw, a collection of all the literary notices, that
had then appeared, of his early Poems and Satire,&mdash;written over on the
margin, with observations of her own, which to my informant appeared
indicative of much more sense and ability than, from her general
character, we should be inclined to attribute to her.</p>

<p>Among those lesser traits of his conduct through which an observer can
trace a filial wish to uphold, and throw respect around, the station of
his mother, may be mentioned his insisting, while a boy, on being called
"George Byron Gordon"&mdash;giving thereby precedence to the maternal
name,&mdash;and his continuing, to the last, to address her as "the
Honourable Mrs. Byron,"&mdash;a mark of rank to which, he must have been
aware, she had no claim whatever. Neither does it appear that, in his
habitual manner towards her, there was any thing denoting a want of
either affection or deference,&mdash;with the exception, perhaps,
occasionally, of a somewhat greater degree of familiarity than comports
with the ordinary notions of filial respect. Thus, the usual name he
called her by, when they were on good-humoured terms together, was
"Kitty Gordon;"<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>Pg 37</span> and I have heard an eye-witness of the scene describe
the look of arch, dramatic humour, with which, one day, at Southwell,
when they were in the height of their theatrical rage, he threw open the
door of the drawing-room, to admit his mother, saying, at the same time,
"Enter the Honourable Kitty."</p>

<p>The pride of birth was a feeling common alike to mother and son, and, at
times, even became a point of rivalry between them, from their
respective claims, English and Scotch, to high lineage. In a letter
written by him from Italy, referring to some anecdote which his mother
had told him, he says,&mdash;"My mother, who was as haughty as Lucifer with
her descent from the Stuarts, and her right line from the <i>old
Gordons</i>,&mdash;<i>not</i> the <i>Seyton Gordons</i>, as she disdainfully termed the
ducal branch,&mdash;told me the story, always reminding me how superior <i>her</i>
Gordons were to the southern Byrons, notwithstanding our Norman, and
always masculine, descent, which has never lapsed into a female, as my
mother's Gordons had done in her own person."</p>

<p>If, to be able to depict powerfully the painful emotions, it is
necessary first to have experienced them, or, in other words, if, for
the poet to be great, the man must suffer, Lord Byron, it must be owned,
paid early this dear price of mastery. Few as were the ties by which his
affections held, whether within or without the circle of relationship,
he was now doomed, within a short space, to see the most of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>Pg 38</span> them swept
away by death.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Besides the loss of his mother, he had to mourn over,
in quick succession, the untimely fatalities that carried off, within a
few weeks of each other, two or three of his most loved and valued
friends. "In the short space of one month," he says, in a note on Childe
Harold, "I have lost <i>her</i> who gave me being, and most of those who made
that being tolerable."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Of these young Wingfield, whom we have seen
high on the list of his Harrow favourites, died of a fever at Coimbra;
and Matthews, the idol of his admiration at college, was drowned while
bathing in the waters of the Cam.</p>

<p>The following letter, written immediately after the latter event, bears
the impress of strong and even agonised feeling, to such a degree as
renders it almost painful to read it:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>Pg 39</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 56. TO MR. SCROPE DAVIES.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, August 7. 1811.</p>

<p>"My dearest Davies,</p>

<p>"Some curse hangs over me and mine. My mother lies a corpse in this
house; one of my best friends is drowned in a ditch. What can I
say, or think, or do? I received a letter from him the day before
yesterday. My dear Scrope, if you can spare a moment, do come down
to me&mdash;I want a friend. Matthews's last letter was written on
<i>Friday</i>,&mdash;on Saturday he was not. In ability, who was like
Matthews? How did we all shrink before him? You do me but justice
in saying, I would have risked my paltry existence to have
preserved his. This very evening did I mean to write, inviting him,
as I invite you, my very dear friend, to visit me. God forgive * *
* for his apathy! What will our poor Hobhouse feel? His letters
breathe but or Matthews. Come to me, Scrope, I am almost
desolate&mdash;left almost alone in the world&mdash;I had but you, and H.,
and M., and let me enjoy the survivors whilst I can. Poor M., in
his letter of Friday, speaks of his intended contest for
Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>Pg 40</span> a speedy journey to London. Write or come, but
come if you can, or one or both.</p>

<p>"Yours ever."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of this remarkable young man, Charles Skinner Matthews<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, I have
already had occasion to speak; but the high station which he held in
Lord Byron's affection and admiration may justify a somewhat ampler
tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>There have seldom, perhaps, started together in life so many youths of
high promise and hope as were to be found among the society of which
Lord Byron formed a part at Cambridge. Of some of these, the names have
since eminently distinguished themselves in the world, as the mere
mention of Mr. Hobhouse and Mr. William Bankes is sufficient to testify;
while in the instance of another of this lively circle, Mr. Scrope
Davies<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, the only regret<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>Pg 41</span> of his friends is, that the social wit of
which he is such a master should in the memories of his hearers alone be
like to leave any record of its brilliancy. Among all these young men of
learning and talent, (including Byron himself, whose genius was,
however, as yet, "an undiscovered world,") the superiority, in almost
every department of intellect, seems to have been, by the ready consent
of all, awarded to Matthews;&mdash;a concurrence of homage which, considering
the persons from whom it came, gives such a high notion of the powers of
his mind at that period, as renders the thought of what he might have
been, if spared, a matter of interesting, though vain and mournful,
speculation. To mere mental pre-eminence, unaccompanied by the kindlier
qualities of the heart, such a tribute, however deserved, might not,
perhaps, have been so uncontestedly paid. But young Matthews
appears,&mdash;in spite of some little asperities of temper and manner, which
he was already beginning to soften down when snatched away,&mdash;to have
been one of those rare individuals who, while they command deference,
can, at the same time, win regard, and who, as it were, relieve the
intense feeling of admiration which they excite by blending it with
love.</p>

<p>To his religious opinions, and their unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>Pg 42</span> coincidence with those
of Lord Byron, I have before adverted. Like his noble friend, ardent in
the pursuit of Truth, he, like him too, unluckily lost his way in
seeking her,&mdash;"the light that led astray" being by both friends mistaken
for hers. That in his scepticism he proceeded any farther than Lord
Byron, or ever suffered his doubting, but still ingenuous, mind to
persuade itself into the "incredible creed" of atheism, is, I find
(notwithstanding an assertion in a letter of the noble poet to this
effect), disproved by the testimony of those among his relations and
friends, who are the most ready to admit and, of course, lament his
other heresies;&mdash;nor should I have felt that I had any right to allude
thus to the religious opinions of one who had never, by promulgating his
heterodoxy, brought himself within the jurisdiction of the public, had
not the wrong impression, as it appears, given of those opinions, on the
authority of Lord Byron, rendered it an act of justice to both friends
to remove the imputation.</p>

<p>In the letters to Mrs. Byron, written previously to the departure of her
son on his travels, there occurs, it will be recollected, some mention
of a Will, which it was his intention to leave behind him in the hands
of his trustees. Whatever may have been the contents of this former
instrument, we find that, in about a fortnight after his mother's death,
he thought it right to have a new form of will drawn up; and the
following letter, enclosing his instructions for that purpose, was
addressed to the late Mr. Bolton, a solicitor of Nottingham. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>Pg 43</span> the
existence, in any serious or formal shape, of the strange directions
here given, respecting his own interment, I was, for some time, I
confess, much inclined to doubt; but the curious documents here annexed
put this remarkable instance of his eccentricity beyond all question.</p>

shall here give one or two of the clauses in full, with the respective
queries and answers annexed.</p>

month; and whilst I had heard from <i>all three</i>, but not seen <i>one</i>.
Matthews wrote to me the very day before his death; and though I
feel for his fate, I am still more anxious for Hobhouse, who, I
very much fear, will hardly retain<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>Pg 50</span> his senses: his letters to me
since the event have been most incoherent. But let this pass; we

of such things, and our very sorrow is selfish.</p>

me from duly noticing.&mdash;I hope your friends and family will long

familiar with the dead. It is strange that I look on the skulls
which stand beside me (I have always had <i>four</i> in my study)
without emotion, but I cannot strip the features of those I have

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, August 22. 1811.</p>

<p>"You may have heard of the sudden death of my mother, and poor
Matthews, which, with that of Wingfield, (of which I was not fully
aware till just before I left town, and indeed hardly believed it,)
has made a sad chasm in my connections. Indeed the blows followed
each other so rapidly that I am yet stupid from the shock; and
though I do eat, and drink, and talk, and even laugh, at times, yet
I can hardly persuade myself that I am awake, did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>Pg 51</span> every
morning convince me mournfully to the contrary.&mdash;I shall now wave
the subject,&mdash;the dead are at rest, and none but the dead can be
so.</p>

<p>"You will feel for poor Hobhouse,&mdash;Matthews was the 'god of his
idolatry;' and if intellect could exalt a man above his fellows, no
one could refuse him pre-eminence. I knew him most intimately, and
valued him proportionably; but I am recurring&mdash;so let us talk of
life and the living.</p>

<p>"If you should feel a disposition to come here, you will find 'beef
and a sea-coal fire,' and not ungenerous wine. Whether Otway's two
other requisites for an Englishman or not, I cannot tell, but
probably one of them.&mdash;Let me know when I may expect you, that I
may tell you when I go and when return. I have not yet been to
Lanes. Davies has been here, and has invited me to Cambridge for a
week in October, so that, peradventure, we may encounter glass to
glass. His gaiety (death cannot mar it) has done me service; but,
after all, ours was a hollow laughter.</p>

<p>"You will write to me? I am solitary, and I never felt solitude
irksome before. Your anxiety about the critique on * *'s book is
amusing; as it was anonymous, certes it was of little consequence:
I wish it had produced a little more confusion, being a lover of
literary malice. Are you doing nothing? writing nothing? printing
nothing? why not your Satire on Methodism? the subject (supposing
the public to be blind to merit) would do wonders. Besides, it
would be as well for a destined deacon to prove his orthodoxy.&mdash;It
really would give me<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>Pg 52</span> pleasure to see you properly appreciated. I
say <i>really</i>, as, being an author, my humanity might be suspected.

<p>"Your letter gives me credit for more acute feelings than I
possess; for though I feel tolerably miserable, yet I am at the
same time subject to a kind of hysterical merriment, or rather
laughter without merriment, which I can neither account for nor
conquer, and yet I do not feel relieved by it; but an indifferent
person would think me in excellent spirits. 'We must forget these
things,' and have recourse to our old selfish comforts, or rather
comfortable selfishness. I do not think I shall return to London
immediately, and shall therefore accept freely what is offered
courteously&mdash;your mediation between me and Murray. I don't think my
name will answer the purpose, and you must be aware that my plaguy
Satire will bring the north and south Grub Streets down upon the
'Pilgrimage;'&mdash;but, nevertheless, if Murray makes a point of it,
and you coincide with him, I will do it daringly; so let it be
entitled 'By the Author of English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.' My
remarks on the Romaic, &amp;c., once intended to accompany the 'Hints
from Horace,' shall go along with the other, as being indeed more
appropriate; also the smaller poems now in my possession, with a
few selected from those published in * *'s Miscellany. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>Pg 53</span>
found amongst my poor mother's papers all my letters from the East,
and one in particular of some length from Albania. From this, if
necessary, I can work up a note or two on that subject. As I kept
no journal, the letters written on the spot are the best. But of
this anon, when we have definitively arranged.</p>

<p>"Has Murray shown the work to any one? He may&mdash;but I will have no
traps for applause. Of course there are little things I would wish
to alter, and perhaps the two stanzas of a buffooning cast on
London's Sunday are as well left out. I much wish to avoid
identifying Childe Harold's character with mine, and that, in
sooth, is my second objection to my name appearing in the
title-page. When you have made arrangements as to time, size, type,
&amp;c. favour me with a reply. I am giving you an universe of trouble,
which thanks cannot atone for. I made a kind of prose apology for
my scepticism at the head of the MS., which, on recollection, is so
much more like an attack than a defence, that, haply, it might
better be omitted:&mdash;perpend, pronounce. After all, I fear Murray
will be in a scrape with the orthodox; but I cannot help it, though
I wish him well through it. As for me, 'I have supped full of
criticism,' and I don't think that the 'most dismal treatise' will
stir and rouse my fell of hair' till 'Birnam wood do come to
Dunsinane.'</p>

<p>"I shall continue to write at intervals, and hope you will pay me
in kind. How does Pratt get on, or rather get off, Joe Blackett's
posthumous stock? You killed that poor man amongst you, in spite
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>Pg 54</span> your Ionian friend and myself, who would have saved him from
Pratt, poetry, present poverty, and posthumous oblivion. Cruel
patronage! to ruin a man at his calling; but then he is a divine
subject for subscription and biography; and Pratt, who makes the
most of his dedications, has inscribed the volume to no less than
five families of distinction.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you don't like Harry White: with a great deal of cant,
which in him was sincere (indeed it killed him as you killed Joe
Blackett), certes there is poesy and genius. I don't say this on
account of my simile and rhymes; but surely he was beyond all the
Bloomfields and Blacketts, and their collateral cobblers, whom
Lofft and Pratt have or may kidnap from their calling into the
service of the trade. You must excuse my flippancy, for I am
writing I know not what, to escape from myself. Hobhouse is gone to
Ireland. Mr. Davies has been here on his way to Harrowgate.</p>

<p>"You did not know M.: he was a man of the most astonishing powers,
as he sufficiently proved at Cambridge, by carrying off more prizes
and fellow-ships, against the ablest candidates, than any other
graduate on record; but a most decided atheist, indeed noxiously
so, for he proclaimed his principles in all societies. I knew him
well, and feel a loss not easily to be supplied to myself&mdash;to
Hobhouse never. Let me hear from you, and believe me," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 62. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, Notts., August 23. 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"A domestic calamity in the death of a near relation has hitherto
prevented my addressing you on the subject of this letter.&mdash;My
friend, Mr. Dallas, has placed in your hands a manuscript poem
written by me in Greece, which he tells me you do not object to
publishing. But he also informed me in London that you wished to
send the MS. to Mr. Gifford. Now, though no one would feel more
gratified by the chance of obtaining his observations on a work
than myself, there is in such a proceeding a kind of petition for
praise, that neither my pride&mdash;or whatever you please to call
it&mdash;will admit. Mr. G. is not only the first satirist of the day,
but editor of one of the principal reviews. As such, he is the last
man whose censure (however eager to avoid it) I would deprecate by
clandestine means. You will therefore retain the manuscript in your
own care, or, if it must needs be shown, send it to another. Though
not very patient of censure, I would fain obtain fairly any little
praise my rhymes might deserve, at all events not by extortion, and
the humble solicitations of a bandied about MS. I am sure a little
consideration will convince you it would be wrong.</p>

<p>"If you determine on publication, I have some smaller poems (never
published), a few notes, and a short dissertation on the literature
of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>Pg 56</span> Greeks (written at Athens), which will come in at
the end of the volume.&mdash;And, if the present poem should succeed, it
is my intention, at some subsequent period, to publish some
selections from my first work,&mdash;my Satire,&mdash;another nearly the same
length, and a few other things, with the MS. now in your hands, in
two volumes.&mdash;But of these hereafter. You will apprize me of your
determination. I am, Sir, your very obedient," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 63. TO MR. DALLAS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, August 25. 1811.</p>

<p>"Being fortunately enabled to frank, I do not spare scribbling,
having sent you packets within the last ten days. I am passing
solitary, and do not expect my agent to accompany me to Rochdale
before the second week in September; a delay which perplexes me, as
I wish the business over, and should at present welcome employment.
I sent you exordiums, annotations, &amp;c. for the forthcoming quarto,
if quarto it is to be: and I also have written to Mr. Murray my
objection to sending the MS. to Juvenal, but allowing him to show
it to any others of the calling. Hobhouse is amongst the types
already: so, between his prose and my verse, the world will be
decently drawn upon for its paper-money and patience. Besides all
this, my 'Imitation of Horace' is gasping for the press at
Cawthorn's, but I am hesitating as to the <i>how</i> and the <i>when</i>, the
single or the double, the present or the future. You must excuse
all this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>Pg 57</span> for I have nothing to say in this lone mansion but of
myself, and yet I would willingly talk or think of aught else.</p>

<p>"What are you about to do? Do you think of perching in Cumberland,
as you opined when I was in the metropolis? If you mean to retire,
why not occupy Miss * * *'s 'Cottage of Friendship,' late the seat
of Cobbler Joe, for whose death you and others are answerable? His
'Orphan Daughter' (pathetic Pratt!) will, certes, turn out a
shoemaking Sappho. Have you no remorse? I think that elegant
address to Miss Dallas should be inscribed on the cenotaph which
Miss * * * means to stitch to his memory.</p>

<p>"The newspapers seem much disappointed at his Majesty's not dying,
or doing something better. I presume it is almost over. If
parliament meets in October, I shall be in town to attend. I am
also invited to Cambridge for the beginning of that month, but am
first to jaunt to Rochdale. Now Matthews is gone, and Hobhouse in
Ireland, I have hardly one left there to bid me welcome, except my
inviter. At three-and-twenty I am left alone, and what more can we
be at seventy? It is true I am young enough to begin again, but
with whom can I retrace the laughing part of life? It is odd how
few of my friends have died a quiet death,&mdash;I mean, in their beds.
But a quiet life is of more consequence. Yet one loves squabbling
and jostling better than yawning. This <i>last word</i> admonishes me to
relieve you from yours very truly," &amp;c.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>Pg 58</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, August 27. 1811.</p>

<p>"I was so sincere in my note on the late Charles Matthews, and do
feel myself so totally unable to do justice to his talents, that
the passage must stand for the very reason you bring against it. To
him all the men I ever knew were pigmies. He was an intellectual
giant. It is true I loved W. better; he was the earliest and the
dearest, and one of the few one could never repent of having loved:
but in ability&mdash;ah! you did not know Matthews!</p>

<p>"'Childe Harold' may wait and welcome&mdash;books are never the worse
for delay in the publication. So you have got our heir, George
Anson Byron, and his sister, with you.</p>

<p>"You may say what you please, but you are one of the <i>murderers</i> of
Blackett, and yet you won't allow Harry White's genius. Setting
aside his bigotry, he surely ranks next Chatterton. It is
astonishing how little he was known; and at Cambridge no one
thought or heard of such a man till his death rendered all notice
useless. For my own part, I should have been most proud of such an
acquaintance: his very prejudices were respectable. There is a
sucking epic poet at Granta, a Mr. Townsend, <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the late
Cumberland. Did you ever hear of him and his 'Armageddon?' I think
his plan (the man I don't know) borders on the sublime: though,
perhaps, the anticipation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>Pg 59</span> the 'Last Day' (according to you
Nazarenes) is a little too daring: at least, it looks like telling
the Lord what he is to do, and might remind an ill-natured person
of the line,</p>

all the lambs of Jacob Behmen about his ears. However, I hope he
will bring it to a conclusion, though Milton is in his way.</p>

George by the hand for me; but, take care, for he has a sad sea
paw.</p>

<p>"P.S. I would ask George here, but I don't know how to amuse
him&mdash;all my horses were sold when I left England, and I have not
had time to replace them. Nevertheless, if he will come down and
shoot in September, he will be very welcome: but he must bring a
gun, for I gave away all mine to Ali Pacha, and other Turks. Dogs,

<p><b>LETTER 65. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, Notts., Sept. 5. 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"The time seems to be past when (as Dr. Johnson said) a man was
certain to 'hear the truth from his bookseller,' for you have paid
me so many compliments, that, if I was not the veriest scribbler on
earth, I should feel affronted. As I accept your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>Pg 60</span> compliments, it
is but fair I should give equal or greater credit to your
objections, the more so, as I believe them to be well founded. With
regard to the political and metaphysical parts, I am afraid I can
alter nothing; but I have high authority for my errors in that
point, for even the <i>&AElig;neid</i> was a <i>political</i> poem, and written for
a <i>political</i> purpose; and as to my unlucky opinions on subjects of
more importance, I am too sincere in them for recantation. On
Spanish affairs I have said what I saw, and every day confirms me
in that notion of the result formed on the spot; and I rather think
honest John Bull is beginning to come round again to that sobriety
which Massena's retreat had begun to reel from its centre&mdash;the
usual consequence of <i>un</i>usual success. So you perceive I cannot
alter the sentiments; but if there are any alterations in the
structure of the versification you would wish to be made, I will
tag rhymes and turn stanzas as much as you please. As for the
'<i>orthodox</i>,' let us hope they will buy, on purpose to abuse&mdash;you
will forgive the one, if they will do the other. You are aware that
any thing from my pen must expect no quarter, on many accounts; and
as the present publication is of a nature very different from the
former, we must not be sanguine.</p>

<p>"You have given me no answer to my question&mdash;tell me fairly, did
you show the MS. to some of your corps?&mdash;I sent an introductory
stanza to Mr. Dallas, to be forwarded to you; the poem else will
open too abruptly. The stanzas had better be numbered in Roman
characters. There is a disquisition<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>Pg 61</span> on the literature of the
modern Greeks and some smaller poems to come in at the close. These
are now at Newstead, but will be sent in time. If Mr. D. has lost
the stanza and note annexed to it, write, and I will send it
myself.&mdash;You tell me to add two Cantos, but I am about to visit my
<i>collieries</i> in Lancashire on the 15th instant, which is so
unpoetical an employment that I need say no more. I am, sir, your
most obedient," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The manuscripts of both his poems having been shown, much against
his own will, to Mr. Gifford, the opinion of that gentleman was
thus reported to him by Mr. Dallas:&mdash;"Of your Satire he spoke
highly; but this poem (Childe Harold) he pronounced not only the
best you have written, but equal to any of the present age."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 66. TO MR. DALLAS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, September 7. 1811.</p>

<p>"As Gifford has been ever my 'Magnus Apollo.' any approbation, such
as you mention, would, of course, be more welcome than 'all
Bokara's vaunted gold, than all the gems of Samarkand.' But I am
sorry the MS. was shown to him in such a manner, and I had written
to Murray to say as much, before I was aware that it was too late.</p>

<p>"Your objection to the expression 'central line' I can only meet by
saying that, before Childe Harold left England, it was his full
intention to traverse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>Pg 62</span> Persia, and return by India, which he could
not have done without passing the equinoctial.</p>

<p>"The other errors you mention, I must correct in the progress
through the press. I feel honoured by the wish of such men that the
poem should be continued, but to do that, I must return to Greece
and Asia; I must have a warm sun and a blue sky; I cannot describe
scenes so dear to me by a sea-coal fire. I had projected an
additional Canto when I was in the Troad and Constantinople, and if
I saw them again, it would go on; but under existing circumstances
and <i>sensations</i>, I have neither harp, 'heart, nor voice' to
proceed. I feel that <i>you are all right</i> as to the metaphysical
part; but I also feel that I am sincere, and that if I am only to
write '<i>ad captandum vulgus</i>,' I might as well edit a magazine at
once, or spin canzonettas for Vauxhall. * * *</p>

<p>"My work must make its way as well as it can; I know I have every
thing against me, angry poets and prejudices; but if the poem is a
<i>poem</i>, it will surmount these obstacles, and if <i>not</i>, it deserves
its fate. Your friend's Ode I have read&mdash;it is no great compliment
to pronounce it far superior to S * *'s on the same subject, or to
the merits of the new Chancellor. It is evidently the production of
a man of taste, and a poet, though I should not be willing to say
it was fully equal to what might be expected from the author of
'<i>Hor&aelig; Ionic&aelig;</i>.' I thank you for it, and that is more than I would
do for any other Ode of the present day.</p>

<p>"I am very sensible of your good wishes, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>Pg 63</span> indeed, I have need
of them. My whole life has been at variance with propriety, not to
say decency; my circumstances are become involved; my friends are
dead or estranged, and my existence a dreary void. In Matthews I
have lost my 'guide, philosopher, and friend;' in Wingfield a
friend only, but one whom I could have wished to have preceded in
his long journey.</p>

<p>"Matthews was indeed an extraordinary man; it has not entered into
the heart of a stranger to conceive such a man: there was the stamp
of immortality in all he said or did;&mdash;and now what is he? When we
see such men pass away and be no more&mdash;men, who seem created to
display what the Creator <i>could make</i> his creatures, gathered into
corruption, before the maturity of minds that might have been the
pride of posterity, what are we to conclude? For my own part, I am
bewildered. To me he was much, to Hobhouse every thing.&mdash;My poor
Hobhouse doted on Matthews. For me, I did not love quite so much as
I honoured him; I was indeed so sensible of his infinite
superiority, that though I did not envy, I stood in awe of it. He,
Hobhouse, Davies, and myself, formed a coterie of our own at
Cambridge and elsewhere. Davies is a wit and man of the world, and
feels as much as such a character can do; but not as Hobhouse has
been affected. Davies, who is not a scribbler, has always beaten us
all in the war of words, and by his colloquial powers at once
delighted and kept us in order. H. and myself always had the worst
of it with the other two; and even M. yielded to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>Pg 64</span> dashing
vivacity of S.D. But I am talking to you of men, or boys, as if you
cared about such beings.</p>

<p>"I expect mine agent down on the 14th to proceed to Lancashire,
where I hear from all quarters that I have a very valuable property
in coals, &amp;c. I then intend to accept an invitation to Cambridge in
October, and shall, perhaps, run up to town. I have four
invitations&mdash;to Wales, Dorset, Cambridge, and Chester; but I must
be a man of business. I am quite alone, as these long letters sadly
testify. I perceive, by referring to your letter, that the Ode is
from the author; make my thanks acceptable to him. His muse is
worthy a nobler theme. You will write as usual, I hope. I wish you

corner-stone of an <i>errata</i> column.</p>

<p>"I am now not quite alone, having an old acquaintance and
school-fellow with me, so <i>old</i>, indeed, that we have nothing <i>new</i>
to say on any subject, and yawn at each other in a sort of <i>quiet
inquietude</i>. I hear nothing from Cawthorn, or Captain Hob<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>Pg 67</span>house;
and <i>their quarto</i>&mdash;Lord have mercy on mankind! We come on like
Cerberus with our triple publications. As for <i>myself</i>, by
<i>myself</i>, I must be satisfied with a comparison to <i>Janus</i>.</p>

<p>"I am not at all pleased with Murray for showing the MS.; and I am
certain Gifford must see it in the same light that I do. His praise
is nothing to the purpose: what could he say? He could not spit in
the face of one who had praised him in every possible way. I must
own that I wish to have the impression removed from his mind, that
I had any concern in such a paltry transaction. The more I think,
the more it disquiets me; so I will say no more about it. It is bad
enough to be a scribbler, without having recourse to such shifts to
extort praise, or deprecate censure. It is anticipating, it is
begging, kneeling, adulating,&mdash;the devil! the devil! the devil! and
all without my wish, and contrary to my express desire. I wish
Murray had been tied to <i>Payne</i>'s neck when he jumped into the
Paddington Canal<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, and so tell him,&mdash;<i>that</i> is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>Pg 68</span> proper
receptacle for publishers. You have thoughts of settling in the
country, why not try Notts.? I think there are places which would
suit you in all points, and then you are nearer the metropolis. But
of this anon. I am, yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, Sept. 21. 1811.</p>

<p>"I have shown my respect for your suggestions by adopting them; but
I have made many alterations in the first proof, over and above;
as, for example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Oh Thou, in <i>Hellas</i> deem'd of heavenly birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Yet there <i>I've wander'd</i> by the vaunted rill;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so on. So I have got rid of Dr. Lowth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>Pg 69</span> 'drunk' to boot, and
very glad I am to say so. I have also sullenised the line as
heretofore, and in short have been quite conformable.</p>

<p>"Pray write; you shall hear when I remove to Lancs. I have brought
you and my friend Juvenal Hodgson upon my back, on the score of
revelation. You are fervent, but he is quite <i>glowing</i>; and if he
take half the pains to save his own soul, which he volunteers to
redeem mine, great will be his reward hereafter. I honour and thank
you both, but am convinced by neither. Now for notes. Besides those
I have sent, I shall send the observations on the Edinburgh
Reviewer's remarks on the modern Greek, an Albanian song in the
Albanian (<i>not Greek</i>) language, specimens of modern Greek from
their New Testament, a comedy of Goldoni's translated, <i>one scene</i>,
a prospectus of a friend's book, and perhaps a song or two, <i>all</i>
in Romaic, besides their Pater Noster; so there will be enough, if
not too much, with what I have already sent. Have you received the
'Noetes Attic&aelig;?' I sent also an annotation on Portugal. Hobhouse is
also forthcoming."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, Sept. 23. 1811.</p>

<p>"<i>Lisboa</i> is the Portuguese word, consequently the very best.
Ulissipont is pedantic; and as I have <i>Hellas</i> and <i>Eros</i> not long
before, there would be something like an affectation of Greek
terms, which I wish to avoid, since I shall have a perilous<span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>Pg 70</span>
quantity of <i>modern</i> Greek in my notes, as specimens of the tongue;
therefore Lisboa may keep its place. You are right about the
'Hints;' they must not precede the 'Romaunt;' but Cawthorn will be
savage if they don't; however, keep <i>them</i> back, and <i>him</i> in <i>good
humour</i>, if we can, but do not let him publish.</p>

<p>"I have adopted, I believe, most of your suggestions, but 'Lisboa'
will be an exception to prove the rule. I have sent a quantity of
notes, and shall continue; but pray let them be copied; no devil
can read my hand. By the by, I do not mean to exchange the ninth
verse of the 'Good Night.' I have no reason to suppose my dog
better than his brother brutes, mankind; and <i>Argus</i> we know to be
a fable. The 'Cosmopolite' was an acquisition abroad. I do not
believe it is to be found in England. It is an amusing little
volume, and full of French flippancy. I read, though I do not speak
the language.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> be angry with Murray. It was a book-selling, back shop,
Paternoster-row, paltry proceeding, and if the experiment had
turned out as it deserved, I would have raised all Fleet Street,
and borrowed the giant's staff from St. Dunstan's church, to
immolate the betrayer of trust. I have written to him as he never
was written to before by an author, I'll be sworn, and I hope you
will amplify my wrath, till it has an effect upon him. You tell me
always you have much to write about. Write it, but let us drop
metaphysics;&mdash;on that point we shall never agree. I am dull and
drowsy, as usual.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>Pg 71</span> I do nothing, and even that nothing fatigues me.

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, Oct. 11. 1811.</p>

<p>"I have returned from Lancs., and ascertained that my property
there may be made very valuable, but various circumstances very
much circumscribe my exertions at present. I shall be in town on
business in the beginning of November, and perhaps at Cambridge
before the end of this month; but of my movements you shall be
regularly apprised. Your objections I have in part done away by
alterations, which I hope will suffice; and I have sent two or
three additional stanzas for both '<i>Fyttas</i>' I have been again
shocked with a death, and have lost one very dear to me in happier
times; but 'I have almost forgot the taste of grief,' and 'supped
full of horrors' till I have become callous, nor have I a tear left
for an event which, five years ago, would have bowed down my head
to the earth. It seems as though I were to experience in my youth
the greatest misery of age. My friends fall around me, and I shall
be left a lonely tree before I am withered. Other men can always
take refuge in their families; I have no resource but my own
reflections, and they present no prospect here or hereafter, except
the selfish satisfaction of surviving my betters. I am indeed very
wretched, and you will excuse my saying so, as you know I am not
apt to cant of sensibility.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>Pg 72</span></p>

<p>"Instead of tiring yourself with <i>my</i> concerns, I should be glad to
hear <i>your</i> plans of retirement. I suppose you would not like to be
wholly shut out of society? Now I know a large village, or small
town, about twelve miles off, where your family would have the
advantage of very genteel society, without the hazard of being
annoyed by mercantile affluence; where <i>you</i> would meet with men of
information and independence; and where I have friends to whom I
should be proud to introduce you. There are, besides, a
coffee-room, assemblies, &amp;c. &amp;c., which bring people together. My
mother had a house there some years, and I am well acquainted with
the economy of Southwell, the name of this little commonwealth.
Lastly, you will not be very remote from me; and though I am the
very worst companion for young people in the world, this objection
would not apply to <i>you</i>, whom I could see frequently. Your
expenses, too, would be such as best suit your inclinations, more
or less, as you thought proper; but very little would be requisite
to enable you to enter into all the gaieties of a country life. You
could be as quiet or bustling as you liked, and certainly as well
situated as on the lakes of Cumberland, unless you have a
particular wish to be <i>picturesque</i>.</p>

<p>"Pray, is your Ionian friend in town? You have promised me an
introduction.&mdash;You mention having consulted some friend on the
MSS.&mdash;Is not this contrary to our usual way? Instruct Mr. Murray
not to allow his shopman to call the work 'Child of Harrow's
Pilgrimage!!!!!' as he has done to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>Pg 73</span> of my astonished friends,
who wrote to enquire after my sanity on the occasion, as well they
might. I have heard nothing of Murray, whom I scolded heartily.
Must I write more notes?&mdash;Are there not enough?&mdash;Cawthorn must be
kept back with the 'Hints.'&mdash;I hope he is getting on with
Hobhouse's quarto. Good evening. Yours ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Of the same date with this melancholy letter are the following verses,
never before printed, which he wrote in answer to some lines received
from a friend, exhorting him to be cheerful, and to "banish care." They

recent sorrow, he reverted to the disappointment of his early affection,
as the chief source of all his sufferings and errors, present and to

<p>The anticipations of his own future career in these concluding lines are
of a nature, it must be owned, to awaken more of horror than of
interest, were we not prepared, by so many instances of his exaggeration
in this respect, not to be startled at any lengths to which the spirit
of self-libelling would carry him. It seemed as if, with the power of
painting fierce and gloomy personages, he had also the ambition to be,
himself, the dark "sublime he drew," and that, in his fondness for the
delineation of heroic crime, he endeavoured to fancy, where he could not
find, in his own character, fit subjects for his pencil.</p>

<p>It was about the time when he was thus bitterly feeling and expressing
the blight which his heart had suffered from a <i>real</i> object of
affection, that his poems on the death of an <i>imaginary</i> one, "Thyrza,"
were written;&mdash;nor is it any wonder, when we consider the peculiar
circumstances under which these beautiful effusions flowed from his
fancy, that of all his strains of pathos, they should be the most
touching and most pure. They were, indeed, the essence, the abstract
spirit, as it were, of many griefs;&mdash;a confluence of sad thoughts from
many<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>Pg 76</span> sources of sorrow, refined and warmed in their passage through his
fancy, and forming thus one deep reservoir of mournful feeling. In
retracing the happy hours he had known with the friends now lost, all
the ardent tenderness of his youth came back upon him. His school-sports
with the favourites of his boyhood, Wingfield and Tattersall,&mdash;his
summer days with Long<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, and those evenings of music and romance which
he had dreamed away in the society of his adopted brother,
Eddlestone,&mdash;all these recollections of the young and dead now came to
mingle themselves in his mind with the image of her who, though living,
was, for him, as much lost as they, and diffused that general feeling of
sadness and fondness through his soul, which found a vent in these
poems. No friendship, however warm, could have inspired sorrow so
passionate; as no love, however pure, could have kept passion so
chastened. It was the blending of the two affections, in his memory and
imagination, that thus gave birth to an ideal object combining the best
features of both, and drew from him these saddest and tenderest of
love-poems, in which we find all the depth and intensity of real feeling
touched over with such a light as no reality ever wore.</p>

<p>"You will begin to deem me a most liberal correspondent; but as my

you answers in prose and verse<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to all your late communications,
and though I am invading your ease again, I don't know why, or what
to put down that you are not acquainted with already. I am growing
nervous (how you will laugh!)&mdash;but it is true,&mdash;really, wretchedly,
ridiculously, fine-ladically <i>nervous</i>. Your climate kills me; I
can neither read, write, nor amuse myself, or any one else. My days
are listless, and my nights restless; I have very seldom any
society, and when I have, I run out of it. At 'this present
writing,' there are in the next room three ladies, and I have
stolen away to write this grumbling letter.&mdash;I don't know that I
sha'n't end with insanity, for I find a want of method in arranging
my thoughts that perplexes me strangely; but this looks more like
silliness than madness, as Scrope Davies would facetiously remark
in his consoling manner. I must try the hartshorn of your company;
and a session of Parliament would suit me well,&mdash;any thing to cure
me of conjugating the accursed verb '<i>ennuyer</i>.'</p>

<p>"When shall you be at Cambridge? You have hinted, I think, that
your friend Bland is returned from Holland. I have always had a
great respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>Pg 78</span> for his talents, and for all that I have heard of
his character; but of me, I believe he knows nothing, except that
he heard my sixth form repetitions ten months together, at the
average of two lines a morning, and those never perfect. I
remembered him and his 'Slaves' as I passed between Capes Matapan,
St. Angelo, and his Isle of Ceriga, and I always bewailed the
absence of the Anthology. I suppose he will now translate Vondel,
the Dutch Shakspeare, and 'Gysbert van Amstel' will easily be
accommodated to our stage in its present state; and I presume he
saw the Dutch poem, where the love of Pyramus and Thisbe is
compared to the <i>passion</i> of <i>Christ</i>; also the love of <i>Lucifer</i>
for Eve, and other varieties of Low Country literature. No doubt
you will think me crazed to talk of such things, but they are all
in black and white and good repute on the banks of every canal from
Amsterdam to Alkmaar.</p>

<p>It was at this period that I first had the happiness of seeing and
becoming acquainted with Lord Byron.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>Pg 80</span> The correspondence in which our
acquaintance originated is, in a high degree, illustrative of the frank
manliness of his character; and as it was begun on my side, some egotism
must be tolerated in the detail which I have to give of the
circumstances that led to it. So far back as the year 1806, on the
occasion of a meeting which took place at Chalk Farm between Mr. Jeffrey
and myself, a good deal of ridicule and raillery, founded on a false
representation of what occurred before the magistrates at Bow Street,
appeared in almost all the public prints. In consequence of this, I was
induced to address a letter to the Editor of one of the Journals,
contradicting the falsehood that had been circulated, and stating
briefly the real circumstances of the case. For some time my letter
seemed to produce the intended effect,&mdash;but, unluckily, the original
story was too tempting a theme for humour and sarcasm to be so easily
superseded by mere matter of fact. Accordingly, after a little time,
whenever the subject was publicly alluded to,&mdash;more especially by those
who were at all "willing to wound,"&mdash;the old falsehood was, for the sake
of its ready sting, revived.</p>

<p>In the year 1809, on the first appearance of "English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers," I found the author, who was then generally understood to be
Lord Byron, not only jesting on the subject&mdash;and with sufficiently
provoking pleasantry and cleverness&mdash;in his verse, but giving also, in
the more responsible form of a note, an outline of the transaction in
accordance with the original misreport, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>Pg 81</span> therefore, in direct
contradiction to my published statement. Still, as the Satire was
anonymous and unacknowledged, I did not feel that I was, in any way,
called upon to notice it, and therefore dismissed the matter entirely
from my mind. In the summer of the same year appeared the Second Edition
of the work, with Lord Byron's name prefixed to it. I was, at the time,
in Ireland, and but little in the way of literary society; and it so
happened that some months passed away before the appearance of this new
edition was known to me. Immediately on being apprised of it,&mdash;the
offence now assuming a different form,&mdash;I addressed the following letter
to Lord Byron, and, transmitting it to a friend in London, requested
that he would have it delivered into his Lordship's hands.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dublin, January 1. 1810.</p>

<p>"My Lord,</p>

<p>"Having just seen the name of 'Lord Byron' prefixed to a work
entitled 'English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,' in which, as it
appears to me, <i>the lie is given</i> to a public statement of mine,
respecting an affair with Mr. Jeffrey some years since,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>Pg 82</span> I beg you
will have the goodness to inform me whether I may consider your
Lordship as the author of this publication.</p>

<p>"I shall not, I fear, be able to return to London for a week or
two; but, in the mean time, I trust your Lordship will not deny me
the satisfaction of knowing whether you avow the insult contained
in the passages alluded to.</p>

<p>"It is needless to suggest to your Lordship the propriety of
keeping our correspondence secret.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be</p>

<p>"Your Lordship's very humble servant,</p>

<p>"THOMAS MOORE.</p>

<p>"22. Molesworth Street."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the course of a week, the friend to whom I intrusted this letter
wrote to inform me that Lord Byron had, as he learned on enquiring of
his publisher, gone abroad immediately on the publication of his Second
Edition; but that my letter had been placed in the hands of a gentleman,
named Hodgson, who had undertaken to forward it carefully to his
Lordship. Though the latter step was not exactly what I could have
wished, I thought it as well, on the whole, to let my letter take its
chance, and again postponed all consideration of the matter.</p>

<p>During the interval of a year and a half which elapsed before Lord
Byron's return, I had taken upon myself obligations, both as husband and
father, which make most men,&mdash;and especially those who have nothing to
bequeath,&mdash;less willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>Pg 83</span> to expose themselves unnecessarily to danger.
On hearing, therefore, of the arrival of the noble traveller from
Greece, though still thinking it due to myself to follow up my first
request of an explanation, I resolved, in prosecuting that object, to
adopt such a tone of conciliation as should not only prove my sincere
desire of a pacific result, but show the entire freedom from any angry
or resentful feeling with which I took the step. The death of Mrs.
Byron, for some time, delayed my purpose. But as soon after that event
as was consistent with decorum, I addressed a letter to Lord Byron, in
which, referring to my former communication, and expressing some doubts
as to its having ever reached him, I re-stated, in pretty nearly the
same words, the nature of the insult, which, as it appeared to me, the
passage in his note was calculated to convey. "It is now useless," I
continued, "to speak of the steps with which it was my intention to
follow up that letter. The time which has elapsed since then, though it
has done away neither the injury nor the feeling of it, has, in many
respects, materially altered my situation; and the only object which I
have now in writing to your Lordship is to preserve some consistency
with that former letter, and to prove to you that the injured feeling
still exists, however circumstances may compel me to be deaf to its
dictates, at present. When I say 'injured feeling,' let me assure your
Lordship, that there is not a single vindictive sentiment in my mind
towards you. I mean but to express that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>Pg 84</span> uneasiness, under (what I
consider to be) a charge of falsehood, which must haunt a man of any
feeling to his grave, unless the insult be retracted or atoned for; and
which, if I did <i>not</i> feel, I should, indeed, deserve far worse than
your Lordship's satire could inflict upon me." In conclusion I added,
that so far from being influenced by any angry or resentful feeling
towards him, it would give me sincere pleasure if, by any satisfactory
explanation, he would enable me to seek the honour of being henceforward
ranked among his acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>To this letter, Lord Byron returned the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 73. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Cambridge, October 27. 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"Your letter followed me from Notts, to this place, which will
account for the delay of my reply. Your former letter I never had
the honour to receive;&mdash;be assured, in whatever part of the world
it had found me, I should have deemed it my duty to return and
answer it in person.</p>

<p>"The advertisement you mention, I know nothing of.&mdash;At the time of
your meeting with Mr. Jeffrey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>Pg 85</span> I had recently entered College, and
remember to have heard and read a number of squibs on the occasion;
and from the recollection of these I derived all my knowledge on
the subject, without the slightest idea of 'giving the lie' to an
address which I never beheld. When I put my name to the production,
which has occasioned this correspondence, I became responsible to
all whom it might concern,&mdash;to explain where it requires
explanation, and, where insufficiently, or too sufficiently
explicit, at all events to satisfy. My situation leaves me no
choice; it rests with the injured and the angry to obtain
reparation in their own way.</p>

<p>"With regard to the passage in question, <i>you</i> were certainly <i>not</i>
the person towards whom I felt personally hostile. On the contrary,
my whole thoughts were engrossed by one, whom I had reason to
consider as my worst literary enemy, nor could I foresee that his
former antagonist was about to become his champion. You do not
specify what you would wish to have done: I can neither retract nor
apologise for a charge of falsehood which I never advanced.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of the week, I shall be at No. 8. St. James's
Street.&mdash;Neither the letter nor the friend to whom you stated your
intention ever made their appearance.</p>

<p>"Your friend, Mr. Rogers, or any other gentleman delegated by you,
will find me most ready to adopt any conciliatory proposition which
shall not compromise my own honour,&mdash;or, failing in that, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>Pg 86</span> make
the atonement you deem it necessary to require.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

<p>"Your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In my reply to this, I commenced by saying that his Lordship's letter
was, upon the whole, as satisfactory as I could expect. It contained all
that, in the strict <i>diplomatique</i> of explanation, could be required,
namely,&mdash;that he had never seen the statement which I supposed him
wilfully to have contradicted,&mdash;that he had no intention of bringing
against me any charge of falsehood, and that the objectionable passage
of his work was not levelled personally at <i>me</i>. This, I added, was all
the explanation I had a right to expect, and I was, of course, satisfied
with it.</p>

<p>I then entered into some detail relative to the transmission of my first
letter from Dublin,&mdash;giving, as my reason for descending to these minute
particulars, that I did not, I must confess, feel quite easy under the
manner in which his Lordship had noticed the miscarriage of that first
application to him.</p>

<p>My reply concluded thus:&mdash;"As your Lordship does not show any wish to
proceed beyond the rigid formulary of explanation, it is not for me to
make any further advances. We Irishmen, in businesses of this kind,
seldom know any medium between decided hostility and decided
friendship;&mdash;but, as any approaches towards the latter alter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>Pg 87</span>native must
now depend entirely on your Lordship, I have only to repeat that I am
satisfied with your letter, and that I have the honour to be," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the following day I received the annexed rejoinder from Lord Byron:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 74. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, October 29. 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"Soon after my return to England, my friend, Mr. Hodgson, apprised
me that a letter for me was in his possession; but a domestic event
hurrying me from London, immediately after, the letter (which may
most probably be your own) is still <i>unopened in his keeping</i>. If,
on examination of the address, the similarity of the handwriting
should lead to such a conclusion, it shall be opened in your
presence, for the satisfaction of all parties. Mr. H. is at present
out of town;&mdash;on Friday I shall see him, and request him to forward
it to my address.</p>

<p>"With regard to the latter part of both your letters, until the
principal point was discussed between us, I felt myself at a loss
in what manner to reply. Was I to anticipate friendship from one,
who conceived me to have charged him with falsehood? Were not
<i>advances</i>, under such circumstances, to be misconstrued,&mdash;not,
perhaps, by the person to whom they were addressed, but by others?
In <i>my</i> case, such a step was impracticable. If you, who conceived
yourself to be the offended person,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>Pg 88</span> are satisfied that you had no
cause for offence, it will not be difficult to convince me of it.
My situation, as I have before stated, leaves me no choice. I
should have felt proud of your acquaintance, had it commenced under
other circumstances; but it must rest with you to determine how far
it may proceed after so <i>auspicious</i> a beginning. I have the honour
to be," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Somewhat piqued, I own, at the manner in which my efforts towards a more
friendly understanding,&mdash;ill-timed as I confess them to have been,&mdash;were
received, I hastened to close our correspondence by a short note,
saying, that his Lordship had made me feel the imprudence I was guilty
of, in wandering from the point immediately in discussion between us;
and I should now, therefore, only add, that if, in my last letter, I had
correctly stated the substance of his explanation, our correspondence
might, from this moment, cease for ever, as with that explanation I
declared myself satisfied.</p>

<p>This brief note drew immediately from Lord Byron the following frank and
open-hearted reply:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 75. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, October 30. 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"You must excuse my troubling you once more upon this very
unpleasant subject. It would be a satisfaction to me, and I should
think, to your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>Pg 89</span>self, that the unopened letter in Mr. Hodgson's
possession (supposing it to prove your own) should be returned 'in
statu quo' to the writer; particularly as you expressed yourself
'not quite easy under the manner in which I had dwelt on its
miscarriage.'</p>

<p>"A few words more, and I shall not trouble you further. I felt, and
still feel, very much flattered by those parts of your
correspondence, which held out the prospect of our becoming
acquainted. If I did not meet them in the first instance as perhaps
I ought, let the situation I was placed in be my defence. You have
<i>now</i> declared yourself <i>satisfied</i>, and on that point we are no
longer at issue. If, therefore, you still retain any wish to do me
the honour you hinted at, I shall be most happy to meet you, when,
where, and how you please, and I presume you will not attribute my
saying thus much to any unworthy motive. I have the honour to
remain," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On receiving this letter, I went instantly to my friend, Mr. Rogers, who
was, at that time, on a visit at Holland House, and, for the first time,
informed him of the correspondence in which I had been engaged. With his
usual readiness to oblige and serve, he proposed that the meeting
between Lord Byron and myself should take place at his table, and
requested of me to convey to the noble Lord his wish, that he would do
him the honour of naming some day for that purpose. The following is
Lord Byron's answer to the note which I then wrote:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>Pg 90</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 76. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, November 1, 1811.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"As I should be very sorry to interrupt your Sunday's engagement,
if Monday, or any other day of the ensuing week, would be equally
convenient to yourself and friend, I will then have the honour of
accepting his invitation. Of the professions of esteem with which
Mr. Rogers has honoured me, I cannot but feel proud, though
undeserving. I should be wanting to myself, if insensible to the
praise of such a man; and, should my approaching interview with him
and his friend lead to any degree of intimacy with both or either,
I shall regard our past correspondence as one of the happiest
events of my life. I have the honour to be,</p>

<p>"Your very sincere and obedient servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It can hardly, I think, be necessary to call the reader's attention to
the good sense, self-possession, and frankness, of these letters of Lord
Byron. I had placed him,&mdash;by the somewhat national confusion which I had
made of the boundaries of peace and war, of hostility and
friendship,&mdash;in a position which, ignorant as he was of the character of
the person who addressed him, it required all the watchfulness of his
sense of honour to guard from surprise or snare. Hence, the judicious
reserve with which he abstained from noticing my advances towards
acquaintance, till he should have ascertained exactly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>Pg 91</span> whether the
explanation which he was willing to give would be such as his
correspondent would be satisfied to receive. The moment he was set at
rest on this point, the frankness of his nature displayed itself; and
the disregard of all further mediation or etiquette with which he at
once professed himself ready to meet me, "when, where, and how" I
pleased, showed that he could be as pliant and confiding <i>after</i> such an
understanding, as he had been judiciously reserved and punctilious
<i>before</i> it.</p>

<p>Such did I find Lord Byron, on my first experience of him; and such,&mdash;so
open and manly-minded,&mdash;did I find him to the last.</p>

<p>It was, at first, intended by Mr. Rogers that his company at dinner
should not extend beyond Lord Byron and myself; but Mr. Thomas Campbell,
having called upon our host that morning, was invited to join the party,
and consented. Such a meeting could not be otherwise than interesting to
us all. It was the first time that Lord Byron was ever seen by any of
his three companions; while he, on his side, for the first time, found
himself in the society of persons, whose names had been associated with
his first literary dreams, and to <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of whom he looked up with
that tributary admiration<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>Pg 92</span> which youthful genius is ever ready to pay
its precursors.</p>

<p>Among the impressions which this meeting left upon me, what I chiefly
remember to have remarked was the nobleness of his air, his beauty, the
gentleness of his voice and manners, and&mdash;what was, naturally, not the
least attraction&mdash;his marked kindness to myself. Being in mourning for
his mother, the colour, as well of his dress, as of his glossy, curling,
and picturesque hair, gave more effect to the pure, spiritual paleness
of his features, in the expression of which, when he spoke, there was a
perpetual play of lively thought, though melancholy was their habitual
character when in repose.</p>

<p>As we had none of us been apprised of his peculiarities with respect to
food, the embarrassment of our host was not a little, on discovering
that there was nothing upon the table which his noble guest could eat or
drink. Neither meat, fish, nor wine, would Lord Byron touch; and of
biscuits and soda-water, which he asked for, there had been, unluckily,
no provision. He professed, however, to be equally well pleased with
potatoes and vinegar; and of these meagre materials contrived to make
rather a hearty dinner.</p>

<p>I shall now resume the series of his correspondence with other friends.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>Pg 93</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 77. TO MR. HARNESS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, Dec. 6. 1811.</p>

<p>"My dear Harness,</p>

<p>"I write again, but don't suppose I mean to lay such a tax on your
pen and patience as to expect regular replies. When you are
inclined, write; when silent, I shall have the consolation of
knowing that you are much better employed. Yesterday, Bland and I
called on Mr. Miller, who, being then out, will call on Bland<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
to-day or to-morrow. I shall certainly endeavour to bring them
together.&mdash;You are censorious, child; when you are a little older,
you will learn to dislike every body, but abuse nobody.</p>

<p>"With regard to the person of whom you speak, your own good sense
must direct you. I never pretend to advise, being an implicit
believer in the old proverb. This present frost is detestable. It
is the first I have felt for these three years, though I longed for
one in the oriental summer, when no such thing is to be had, unless
I had gone to the top of Hymettus for it.</p>

<p>"I thank you most truly for the concluding part of your letter. I
have been of late not much accustomed to kindness from any quarter,
and am not the less pleased to meet with it again from one where I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>Pg 94</span>

seen since my last letter; but on Tuesday he dines with me, and
will meet M * * e, the epitome of all that is exquisite in poetical or

not. I have very little interest with either, and they must arrange

can make you.</p>

to become; but then you shall be as quiet at Newstead as you
please, and I won't disturb your studies as I do now. When do you
fix the day, that I may take you up according to contract? Hodgson
talks of making a third in our journey; but we can't stow him,
inside at least. Positively you shall go with me as was agreed, and
don't let me have any of your <i>politesse</i> to H. on the occasion. I

Coleridge has attacked the 'Pleasures of Hope,' and all other
pleasures whatsoever. Mr. Rogers was present, and heard himself
indirectly <i>rowed</i> by the lecturer. We are going in a party to hear
the new Art of Poetry by this reformed schismatic; and were I one
of these poetical luminaries, or of sufficient consequence to be
noticed by the man of lectures, I should not hear him without an
answer. For you know, 'an' a man will be beaten with brains, he
shall never keep a clean doublet.' C * * will be desperately
annoyed. I never saw a man (and of him I have seen very little) so
sensitive;&mdash;what a happy temperament! I am sorry for it; what can

who was to call on him yesterday.</p>

Cambridge; and, even there, the organ is a sad remembrancer. Things

<p><b>LETTER 81. TO MR. HARNESS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, Dec. 15. 1811.</p>

<p>"I wrote you an answer to your last, which, on reflection, pleases
me as little as it probably has pleased yourself. I will not wait
for your rejoinder; but proceed to tell you, that I had just then
been greeted with an epistle of * *'s, full of his petty
grievances, and this at the moment when (from circumstances it is
not necessary to enter upon) I was bearing up against recollections
to which <i>his</i> imaginary sufferings are as a scratch to a cancer.
These<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>Pg 101</span> things combined, put me out of humour with him and all
mankind. The latter part of my life has been a perpetual struggle
against affections which embittered the earliest portion; and
though I flatter myself I have in a great measure conquered them,
yet there are moments (and this was one) when I am as foolish as
formerly. I never said so much before, nor had I said this now, if
I did not suspect myself of having been rather savage in my letter,
and wish to inform you thus much of the cause. You know I am not
one of your dolorous gentlemen: so now let us laugh again.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I went with Moore to Sydenham to visit Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He
was not visible, so we jogged homeward, merrily enough. To-morrow I
dine with Rogers, and am to hear Coleridge, who is a kind of rage
at present. Last night I saw Kemble in Coriolanus;&mdash;he <i>was
glorious</i>, and exerted himself wonderfully. By good luck I got an
excellent place in the best part of the house, which was more than
overflowing. Clare and Delawarre, who were there on the same
speculation, were less fortunate. I saw them by accident,&mdash;we were
not together. I wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>Pg 102</span> for you, to gratify your love of Shakspeare
and of fine acting to its fullest extent. Last week I saw an
exhibition of a different kind in a Mr. Coates, at the Haymarket,
who performed Lothario in a <i>damned</i> and damnable manner.</p>

<p>"I told you the fate of B. and H. in my last. So much for these
sentimentalists, who console themselves in their stews for the
loss&mdash;the never to be recovered loss&mdash;the despair of the refined
attachment of a couple of drabs! You censure <i>my</i> life,
Harness,&mdash;when I compare myself with these men, my elders and my
betters, I really begin to conceive myself a monument of
prudence&mdash;a walking statue&mdash;without feeling or failing; and yet the
world in general hath given me a proud pre-eminence over them in
profligacy. Yet I like the men, and, God knows, ought not to
condemn their aberrations. But I own I feel provoked when they
dignify all this by the name of <i>love</i>&mdash;romantic attachments for
things marketable for a dollar!</p>

<p>"Dec. 16th.&mdash;I have just received your letter;&mdash;I feel your
kindness very deeply. The foregoing part of my letter, written
yesterday, will, I hope, account for the tone of the former, though
it cannot excuse it. I do <i>like</i> to hear from you&mdash;more than
<i>like</i>. Next to seeing you, I have no greater satisfaction. But you
have other duties, and greater pleasures, and I should regret to
take a moment from either. H * * was to call to-day, but I have not
seen him. The circumstances you mention at the close of your letter
is another proof in favour of my opinion of mankind. Such you will
always find<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>Pg 103</span> them&mdash;selfish and distrustful. I except none. The
cause of this is the state of society. In the world, every one is
to stir for himself&mdash;it is useless, perhaps selfish, to expect any
thing from his neighbour. But I do not think we are born of this
disposition; for you find <i>friendship</i> as a schoolboy, and <i>love</i>
enough before twenty.</p>

<p>"I went to see * *; he keeps me in town, where I don't wish to be
at present. He is a good man, but totally without conduct. And now,
my dearest William, I must wish you good morrow, and remain ever,
most sincerely and affectionately yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the time of our first meeting, there seldom elapsed a day that Lord
Byron and I did not see each other; and our acquaintance ripened into
intimacy and friendship with a rapidity of which I have seldom known an
example. I was, indeed, lucky in all the circumstances that attended my
first introduction to him. In a generous nature like his, the pleasure
of repairing an injustice would naturally give a zest to any partiality
I might have inspired in his mind; while the manner in which I had
sought this reparation, free as it was from resentment or defiance, left
nothing painful to remember in the transaction between us,&mdash;no
compromise or concession that could wound self-love, or take away from
the grace of that frank friendship to which he at once, so cordially and
so unhesitatingly, admitted me. I was also not a little fortunate in
forming my acquaintance with him, before his success had yet reached its
meridian burst,&mdash;before<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>Pg 104</span> the triumphs that were in store for him had
brought the world all in homage at his feet, and, among the splendid
crowds that courted his society, even claims less humble than mine had
but a feeble chance of fixing his regard. As it was, the new scene of
life that opened upon him with his success, instead of detaching us from
each other, only multiplied our opportunities of meeting, and increased
our intimacy. In that society where his birth entitled him to move,
circumstances had already placed me, notwithstanding mine; and when,
after the appearance of "Childe Harold," he began to mingle with the
world, the same persons, who had long been <i>my</i> intimates and friends,
became his; our visits were mostly to the same places, and, in the gay
and giddy round of a London spring, we were generally (as in one of his
own letters he expresses it) "embarked in the same Ship of Fools
together."</p>

<p>But, at the time when we first met, his position in the world was most
solitary. Even those coffee-house companions who, before his departure
from England, had served him as a sort of substitute for more worthy
society, were either relinquished or had dispersed; and, with the
exception of three or four associates of his college days (to whom he
appeared strongly attached), Mr. Dallas and his solicitor seemed to be
the only persons whom, even in their very questionable degree, he could
boast of as friends. Though too proud to complain of this loneliness, it
was evident that he felt it; and that the state of cheerless isolation,
"unguided and unfriended," to which, on entering into manhood, he had
found himself abandoned, was one of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>Pg 105</span> sources of that resentful
disdain of mankind, which even their subsequent worship of him came too
late to remove. The effect, indeed, which his subsequent commerce with
society had, for the short period it lasted, in softening and
exhilarating his temper, showed how fit a soil his heart would have been
for the growth of all the kindlier feelings, had but a portion of this
sunshine of the world's smiles shone on him earlier.</p>

<p>At the same time, in all such speculations and conjectures as to what
<i>might</i> have been, under more favourable circumstances, his character,
it is invariably to be borne in mind, that his very defects were among
the elements of his greatness, and that it was out of the struggle
between the good and evil principles of his nature that his mighty
genius drew its strength. A more genial and fostering introduction into
life, while it would doubtless have softened and disciplined his mind,
might have impaired its vigour; and the same influences that would have
diffused smoothness and happiness over his life might have been fatal to
its glory. In a short poem of his<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, which appears to have been
produced at Athens, (as I find it written on a leaf of the original MS.
of Childe Harold, and dated "Athens, 1811,") there are two lines which,
though hardly intelligible as connected with the rest of the poem, may,
taken separately, be interpreted as implying a sort of prophetic
consciousness that it was out of the wreck and ruin of all his hopes the
immortality of his name was to arise.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>Pg 106</span></p>

<p>We frequently, during the first months of our acquaintance, dined
together alone; and as we had no club, in common, to resort to,&mdash;the
Alfred being the only one to which he, at that period, belonged, and I
being then a member of none but Watier's,&mdash;our dinners used to be either
at the St. Alban's, or at his old haunt, Stevens's. Though at times he
would drink freely enough of claret, he still adhered to his system of
abstinence in food. He appeared, indeed, to have conceived a notion that
animal food has some peculiar influence on the character; and I
remember, one day, as I sat opposite to him, employed, I suppose, rather
earnestly over a beef-steak, after watching me for a few seconds, he
said, in a grave tone of enquiry,&mdash;"Moore, don't you find eating
beef-steak makes you ferocious?"</p>

<p>Understanding me to have expressed a wish to become a member of the
Alfred, he very good-naturedly lost no time in proposing me as a
candidate; but as the resolution which I had then nearly formed of
betaking myself to a country life rendered an additional club in London
superfluous, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>Pg 107</span> wrote to beg that he would, for the present, at least,
withdraw my name: and his answer, though containing little, being the
first familiar note he ever honoured me with, I may be excused for
feeling a peculiar pleasure in inserting it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 82. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"December 11. 1811.</p>

<p>"My dear Moore,</p>

<p>"If you please, we will drop our former monosyllables, and adhere
to the appellations sanctioned by our godfathers and godmothers. If
you make it a point, I will withdraw your name; at the same time
there is no occasion, as I have this day postponed your election
'sine die,' till it shall suit your wishes to be amongst us. I do
not say this from any awkwardness the erasure of your proposal
would occasion to <i>me</i>, but simply such is the state of the case;
and, indeed, the longer your name is up, the stronger will become
the probability of success, and your voters more numerous. Of
course you will decide&mdash;your wish shall be my law. If my zeal has
already outrun discretion, pardon me, and attribute my
officiousness to an excusable motive.</p>

<p>"I wish you would go down with me to Newstead. Hodgson will be
there, and a young friend, named Harness, the earliest and dearest
I ever had from the third form at Harrow to this hour. I can
promise you good wine, and, if you like shooting, a manor of 4000
acres, fires, books, your own free<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>Pg 108</span> will, and my own very
indifferent company. 'Balnea, vina * *.'</p>

<p>"Hodgson will plague you, I fear, with verse;&mdash;for my own part I
will conclude, with Martial, 'nil recitabo tibi;' and surely the
last inducement is not the least. Ponder on my proposition, and
believe me, my dear Moore, yours ever,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Among those acts of generosity and friendship by which every year of
Lord Byron's life was signalised, there is none, perhaps, that, for its
own peculiar seasonableness and delicacy, as well as for the perfect
worthiness of the person who was the object of it, deserves more
honourable mention than that which I am now about to record, and which
took place nearly at the period of which I am speaking. The friend,
whose good fortune it was to inspire the feeling thus testified, was Mr.
Hodgson, the gentleman to whom so many of the preceding letters are
addressed; and as it would be unjust to rob him of the grace and honour
of being, himself, the testimony of obligations so signal, I shall here
lay before my readers an extract from the letter with which, in
reference to a passage in one of his noble friend's Journals, he has
favoured me.</p>

<p>"I feel it incumbent upon me to explain the circumstances to which this
passage alludes, however private their nature. They are, indeed,
calculated to do honour to the memory of my lamented friend.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>Pg 109</span> Having
become involved, unfortunately, in difficulties and embarrassments, I
received from Lord Byron (besides former pecuniary obligations)
assistance, at the time in question, to the amount of a thousand pounds.
Aid of such magnitude was equally unsolicited and unexpected on my part;
but it was a long-cherished, though secret, purpose of my friend to
afford that aid; and he only waited for the period when he thought it
would be of most service. His own words were, on the occasion of
conferring this overwhelming favour, '<i>I always intended to do it</i>.'"</p>

<p>During all this time, and through the months of January and February,
his poem of "Childe Harold" was in its progress through the press; and
to the changes and additions which he made in the course of printing,
some of the most beautiful passages of the work owe their existence. On
comparing, indeed, his rough draft of the two Cantos with the finished
form in which they exist at present, we are made sensible of the power
which the man of genius possesses, not only of surpassing others, but of
improving on himself. Originally, the "little Page" and "Yeoman" of the
Childe were introduced to the reader's notice in the following tame
stanzas, by expanding the substance of which into their present light,
lyric shape, it is almost needless to remark how much the poet has
gained in variety and dramatic effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And of his train there was a henchman page,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A peasant boy, who serv'd his master well;<br /></span><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>Pg 110</span></p>
<span class="i2">And often would his pranksome prate engage<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With sullen thoughts that he disdain'd to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then would he smile on him, and Alwin<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When aught that from his young lips archly fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gloomy film from Harold's eye beguiled....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Him and one yeoman only did he take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To travel eastward to a far countrie;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, though the boy was grieved to leave the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On whose fair banks he grew from infancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eftsoons his little heart beat merrily,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With hope of foreign nations to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And many things right marvellous to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of which our vaunting travellers oft have told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Mandeville....<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In place of that mournful song "To Ines," in the first Canto, which
contains some of the dreariest touches of sadness that even his pen ever
let fall, he had, in the original construction of the poem, been so
little fastidious as to content himself with such ordinary sing-song as
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh never tell again to me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Northern climes and British ladies,<br /></span><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>Pg 111</span></p>
<span class="i0">It has not been your lot to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like me, the lovely girl of Cadiz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although her eye be not of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor fair her locks, like English lasses," &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>There were also, originally, several stanzas full of direct personality,
and some that degenerated into a style still more familiar and ludicrous
than that of the description of a London Sunday, which still disfigures
the poem. In thus mixing up the light with the solemn, it was the
intention of the poet to imitate Ariosto. But it is far easier to rise,
with grace, from the level of a strain generally familiar, into an
occasional short burst of pathos or splendour, than to interrupt thus a
prolonged tone of solemnity by any descent into the ludicrous or
burlesque.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the former case, the transition may have the effect of
softening or elevating, while, in the latter, it almost invariably
shocks;&mdash;for the same reason, perhaps, that a trait of pathos or high
feeling, in comedy, has a peculiar charm; while the intrusion of comic
scenes into tragedy, however sanctioned among us by habit and authority,
rarely fails to offend. The noble poet was, himself, convinced of the
failure of the experiment, and in none of the succeeding Cantos of
Childe Harold repeated it.</p>

<p>Of the satiric parts, some verses on the well-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>Pg 112</span>known traveller, Sir John
Carr, may supply us with, at least, a harmless specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sights, saints, antiques, arts, anecdotes, and war,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Go, hie ye hence to Paternoster Row,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are they not written in the boke of Carr?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Green Erin's Knight, and Europe's wandering star.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then listen, readers, to the Man of Ink,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hear what he did, and sought, and wrote afar:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All these are coop'd within one Quarto's brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This borrow, steal (don't buy), and tell us what you think."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among those passages which, in the course of revisal, he introduced,
like pieces of "rich inlay," into the poem, was that fine stanza&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet if, as holiest men have deem'd, there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land of souls beyond that sable shore," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>through which lines, though, it must be confessed, a tone of scepticism
breathes, (as well as in those tender verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes,&mdash;I will dream that we may meet again,")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it is a scepticism whose sadness calls far more for pity than blame;
there being discoverable, even through its very doubts, an innate warmth
of piety, which they had been able to obscure, but not to chill. To use
the words of the poet himself, in a note which it was once his intention
to affix to these stanzas, "Let it be remembered that the spirit they
breathe is desponding, not sneering, scepticism,"&mdash;a distinction never
to be lost sight of; as, however hopeless may be the conversion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>Pg 113</span> the
scoffing infidel, he who feels pain in doubting has still alive within
him the seeds of belief.</p>

<p>At the same time with Childe Harold, he had three other works in the
press,&mdash;his "Hints from Horace," "The Curse of Minerva," and a fifth
edition of "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers." The note upon the
latter poem, which had been the lucky origin of our acquaintance, was
withdrawn in this edition, and a few words of explanation, which he had
the kindness to submit to my perusal, substituted in its place.</p>

<p>In the month of January, the whole of the two Cantos being printed off,
some of the poet's friends, and, among others, Mr. Rogers and myself,
were so far favoured as to be indulged with a perusal of the sheets. In
adverting to this period in his "Memoranda," Lord Byron, I remember,
mentioned,&mdash;as one of the ill omens which preceded the publication of
the poem,&mdash;that some of the literary friends to whom it was shown
expressed doubts of its success, and that one among them had told him
"it was too good for the age." Whoever may have pronounced this
opinion,&mdash;and I have some suspicion that I am myself the guilty
person,&mdash;the age has, it must be owned, most triumphantly refuted the
calumny upon its taste which the remark implied.</p>

<p>It was in the hands of Mr. Rogers I first saw the sheets of the poem,
and glanced hastily over a few of the stanzas which he pointed out to me
as beautiful. Having occasion, the same morning, to write a note to Lord
Byron, I expressed strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>Pg 114</span> the admiration which this foretaste of his
work had excited in me; and the following is&mdash;as far as relates to
literary matters&mdash;the answer I received from him.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 83. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"January 29. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Moore,</p>

<p>"I wish very much I could have seen you; I am in a state of
ludicrous tribulation. * * *</p>

<p>"Why do you say that I dislike your poesy? I have expressed no such
opinion, either in <i>print</i> or elsewhere. In scribbling myself, it
was necessary for me to find fault, and I fixed upon the trite
charge of immorality, because I could discover no other, and was so
perfectly qualified in the innocence of my heart, to 'pluck that
mote from my neighbour's eye.'</p>

<p>"I feel very, very much obliged by your approbation; but, at <i>this
moment</i>, praise, even <i>your</i> praise, passes by me like 'the idle
wind.' I meant and mean to send you a copy the moment of

Snowdon. Believe me, my dear Moore,</p>

<p>The passages here omitted contain rather <i>too</i> amusing an account of a
disturbance that had just<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>Pg 115</span> occurred in the establishment at Newstead, in
consequence of the detected misconduct of one of the maid-servants, who
had been supposed to stand rather too high in the favour of her master,
and, by the airs of authority which she thereupon assumed, had disposed
all the rest of the household to regard her with no very charitable
eyes. The chief actors in the strife were this sultana and young
Rushton; and the first point in dispute that came to Lord Byron's
knowledge (though circumstances, far from creditable to the damsel,
afterwards transpired) was, whether Rushton was bound to carry letters
to "the Hut" at the bidding of this female. To an episode of such a
nature I should not have thought of alluding, were it not for the two
rather curious letters that follow, which show how gravely and coolly
the young lord could arbitrate on such an occasion, and with what
considerate leaning towards the servant whose fidelity he had proved, in
preference to any new liking or fancy by which it might be suspected he
was actuated towards the other.</p>

<p>It was after writing these letters that he came to the knowledge of some
improper levities on the part of the girl, in consequence of which he
dismissed her and another female servant from Newstead; and how strongly
he allowed this discovery to affect his mind, will be seen in a
subsequent letter to Mr. Hodgson.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>Pg 118</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 86. TO MR. HODGSON.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, February 16. 1812.</p>

<p>"Dear Hodgson,</p>

<p>"I send you a proof. Last week I was very ill and confined to bed
with stone in the kidney, but I am now quite recovered. If the
stone had got into my heart instead of my kidneys, it would have
been all the better. The women are gone to their relatives, after
many attempts to explain what was already too clear. However, I
have quite recovered <i>that</i> also, and only wonder at my folly in
excepting my own strumpets from the general corruption,&mdash;albeit a
two months' weakness is better than ten years. I have one request
to make, which is, never mention a woman again in any letter to me,
or even allude to the existence of the sex. I won't even read a
word of the feminine gender;&mdash;it must all be 'propria qu&aelig; maribus.'</p>

<p>"In the spring of 1813 I shall leave England for ever. Every thing
in my affairs tends to this, and my inclinations and health do not
discourage it. Neither my habits nor constitution are improved by
your customs or your climate. I shall find employment in making
myself a good Oriental scholar. I shall retain a mansion in one of
the fairest islands, and retrace, at intervals, the most
interesting portions of the East. In the mean time, I am adjusting
my concerns, which will (when arranged) leave me with wealth
sufficient even for home, but enough for a principality in Turkey.
At present they are in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>Pg 119</span>volved, but I hope, by taking some necessary
but unpleasant steps, to clear every thing. Hobhouse is expected
daily in London; we shall be very glad to see him; and, perhaps,
you will come up and 'drink deep ere he depart,' if not, 'Mahomet
must go to the mountain;'&mdash;but Cambridge will bring sad
recollections to him, and worse to me, though for very different
reasons. I believe the only human being that ever loved me in truth
and entirely was of, or belonging to, Cambridge, and, in that, no
change can now take place. There is one consolation in death&mdash;where
he sets his seal, the impression can neither be melted nor broken,
but endureth for ever.</p>

<p>"Yours always, B."</p></div>

<p>Among those lesser memorials of his good nature and mindfulness, which,
while they are precious to those who possess them, are not unworthy of
admiration from others, may be reckoned such letters as the following,
to a youth at Eton, recommending another, who was about to be entered at
that school, to his care.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 87. TO MASTER JOHN COWELL.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, February 12. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear John,</p>

<p>"You have probably long ago forgotten the writer of these lines,
who would, perhaps, be unable to recognise <i>yourself</i>, from the
difference which must naturally have taken place in your stature
and appearance since he saw you last. I have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>Pg 120</span> rambling through
Portugal, Spain, Greece, &amp;c. &amp;c. for some years, and have found so
many changes on my return, that it would be very unfair not to
expect that you should have had your share of alteration and
improvement with the rest. I write to request a favour of you: a
little boy of eleven years, the son of Mr. * *, my particular
friend, is about to become an Etonian, and I should esteem any act
of protection or kindness to him as an obligation to myself; let me
beg of you then to take some little notice of him at first, till he
is able to shift for himself.</p>

<p>"I was happy to hear a very favourable account of you from a
schoolfellow a few weeks ago, and should be glad to learn that your
family are as well as I wish them to be. I presume you are in the
upper school;&mdash;as an <i>Etonian</i>, you will look down upon a <i>Harrow</i>
man; but I never, even in my boyish days, disputed your
superiority, which I once experienced in a cricket match, where I
had the honour of making one of eleven, who were beaten to their
hearts' content by your college in <i>one innings</i>.</p>

<p>"Believe me to be, with great truth," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the 27th of February, a day or two before the appearance of Childe
Harold, he made the first trial of his eloquence in the House of Lords;
and it was on this occasion he had the good fortune to become acquainted
with Lord Holland,&mdash;an acquaintance no less honourable than gratifying
to both, as having originated in feelings the most generous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>Pg 121</span> perhaps,
of our nature, a ready forgiveness of injuries, on the one side, and a
frank and unqualified atonement for them, on the other. The subject of
debate was the Nottingham Frame-breaking Bill, and, Lord Byron having
mentioned to Mr. Rogers his intention to take a part in the discussion,
a communication was, by the intervention of that gentleman, opened
between the noble poet and Lord Holland, who, with his usual courtesy,
professed himself ready to afford all the information and advice in his
power. The following letters, however, will best explain their first
advances towards acquaintance.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 88. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 4. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"With my best acknowledgments to Lord Holland, I have to offer my
perfect concurrence in the propriety of the question previously to
be put to ministers. If their answer is in the negative, I shall,
with his Lordship's approbation, give notice of a motion for a
Committee of Enquiry. I would also gladly avail myself of his most
able advice, and any information or documents with which he might
be pleased to intrust me, to bear me out in the statement of facts
it may be necessary to submit to the House.</p>

<p>"From all that fell under my own observation during my Christmas
visit to Newstead, I feel convinced that, if <i>conciliatory</i>
measures are not very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>Pg 122</span> soon adopted, the most unhappy consequences
may be apprehended. Nightly outrage and daily depredation are
already at their height, and not only the masters of frames, who
are obnoxious on account of their occupation, but persons in no
degree connected with the malecontents or their oppressors, are
liable to insult and pillage.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken on my
account, and beg you to believe me ever your obliged and sincere,"
&amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 89. TO LORD HOLLAND.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, February 25. 1812.</p>

<p>"My Lord,</p>

<p>"With my best thanks, I have the honour to return the Notts, letter
to your Lordship. I have read it with attention, but do not think I
shall venture to avail myself of its contents, as my view of the
question differs in some measure from Mr. Coldham's. I hope I do
not wrong him, but <i>his</i> objections to the bill appear to me to be
founded on certain apprehensions that he and his coadjutors might
be mistaken for the '<i>original advisers</i>' (to quote him) of the
measure. For my own part, I consider the manufacturers as a much
injured body of men, sacrificed to the views of certain individuals
who have enriched themselves by those practices which have deprived
the frame-workers of employment. For instance;&mdash;by the adoption of
a certain kind of frame, one man performs the work of seven&mdash;six
are thus thrown out of business. But it is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>Pg 123</span> be observed that the
work thus done is far inferior in quality, hardly marketable at
home, and hurried over with a view to exportation. Surely, my Lord,
however we may rejoice in any improvement in the arts which may be
beneficial to mankind, we must not allow mankind to be sacrificed
to improvements in mechanism. The maintenance and well-doing of the
industrious poor is an object of greater consequence to the
community than the enrichment of a few monopolists by any
improvement in the implements of trade, which deprives the workman
of his bread, and renders the, labourer "unworthy of his hire." My
own motive for opposing the bill is founded on its palpable
injustice, and its certain inefficacy. I have seen the state of
these miserable men, and it is a disgrace to a civilised country.
Their excesses may be condemned, but cannot be subject of wonder.
The effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual
rebellion. The few words I shall venture to offer on Thursday will
be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on
the spot. By previous enquiry, I am convinced these men would have
been restored to employment, and the county to tranquillity. It is,
perhaps, not yet too late, and is surely worth the trial. It can
never be too late to employ force in such circumstances. I believe
your Lordship does not coincide with me entirely on this subject,
and most cheerfully and sincerely shall I submit to your superior
judgment and experience, and take some other line of argument
against the bill, or be silent altogether, should you deem it more
advisable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>Pg 124</span> Condemning, as every one must condemn, the conduct of
these wretches, I believe in the existence of grievances which call
rather for pity than punishment. I have the honour to be, with
great respect, my Lord, your Lordship's</p>

<p>"Most obedient and obliged servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON.</p>

<p>"P.S. I am a little apprehensive that your Lordship will think me
too lenient towards these men, and half a <i>framebreaker myself</i>."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It would have been, no doubt, the ambition of Lord Byron to acquire
distinction as well in oratory as in poesy; but Nature seems to set
herself against pluralities in fame. He had prepared himself for this
debate,&mdash;as most of the best orators have done, in their first
essays,&mdash;not only by composing, but writing down, the whole of his
speech beforehand. The reception he met with was flattering; some of the
noble speakers on his own side complimented him very warmly; and that he
was himself highly pleased with his success, appears from the annexed
account of Mr. Dallas, which gives a lively notion of his boyish elation
on the occasion.</p>

<p>"When he left the great chamber, I went and met him in the passage; he
was glowing with success, and much agitated. I had an umbrella in my
right hand, not expecting that he would put out his hand to me;&mdash;in my
haste to take it when offered, I had advanced my left hand&mdash;'What!' said
he, 'give your friend your left hand upon such an occasion?' I showed
the cause, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>Pg 125</span> changing the umbrella to the other hand, I
gave him my right hand, which he shook and pressed warmly. He was
greatly elated, and repeated some of the compliments which had been paid
him, and mentioned one or two of the peers who had desired to be
introduced to him. He concluded with saying, that he had, by his speech,
given me the best advertisement for Childe Harold's Pilgrimage."</p>

<p>The speech itself, as given by Mr. Dallas from the noble speaker's own
manuscript, is pointed and vigorous; and the same sort of interest that
is felt in reading the poetry of a Burke, may be gratified, perhaps, by
a few specimens of the oratory of a Byron. In the very opening of his
speech, he thus introduces himself by the melancholy avowal, that in
that assembly of his brother nobles he stood almost a stranger.</p>

<p>"As a person in some degree connected with the suffering county, though
a stranger not only to this House in general, but to almost every
individual whose attention I presume to solicit, I must claim some
portion of your Lordships' indulgence."</p>

<p>The following extracts comprise, I think, the passages of most spirit:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we are told that these men are leagued together, not only for the
destruction of their own comfort, but of their very means of
subsistence, can we forget that it is the bitter policy, the destructive
warfare, of the last eighteen years which has destroyed their comfort,
your comfort, all men's comfort;&mdash;that policy which, originating with
'great statesmen now no more,' has survived the dead to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>Pg 126</span> become a curse
on the living, unto the third and fourth generation! These men never
destroyed their looms till they were become useless,&mdash;worse than
useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in
obtaining their daily bread. Can you then wonder that, in times like
these, when bankruptcy, convicted fraud, and imputed felony, are found
in a station not far beneath that of your Lordships, the lowest, though
once most useful, portion of the people should forget their duty in
their distresses, and become only less guilty than one of their
representatives? But while the exalted offender can find means to baffle
the law, new capital punishments must be devised, new snares of death
must be spread for the wretched mechanic who is famished into guilt.
These men were willing to dig, but the spade was in other hands: they
were not ashamed to beg, but there was none to relieve them. Their own
means of subsistence were cut off; all other employments pre-occupied;
and their excesses, however to be deplored or condemned, can hardly be
the subject of surprise.</p>

<p>"I have traversed the seat of war in the Peninsula I have been in some
of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey; but never, under the most
despotic of infidel governments, did I behold such squalid wretchedness
as I have seen since my return, in the very heart of a Christian
country. And what are your remedies? After months of inaction, and
months of action worse than inactivity, at length comes forth the grand
specific, the never-failing nostrum of all state physicians from the
days<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>Pg 127</span> of Draco to the present time. After feeling the pulse, and shaking
the head over the patient, prescribing the usual course of warm water
and bleeding&mdash;the warm water of your mawkish police, and the lancets of
your military&mdash;these convulsions must terminate in death, the sure
consummation of the prescriptions of all political Sangrados. Setting
aside the palpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of the bill,
are there not capital punishments sufficient on your statutes? Is there
not blood enough upon your penal code, that more must be poured forth to
ascend to heaven and testify against you? How will you carry this bill
into effect? Can you commit a whole county to their own prisons? Will
you erect a gibbet in every field, and hang up men like scare-crows? or
will you proceed (as you must, to bring this measure into effect,) by
decimation; place the country under martial law; depopulate and lay
waste all around you, and restore Sherwood Forest as an acceptable gift
to the crown in its former condition of a royal chase, and an asylum for
outlaws? Are these the remedies for a starving and desperate populace?
Will the famished wretch who has braved your bayonets be appalled by
your gibbets? When death is a relief, and the only relief it appears
that you will afford him, will he be dragooned into tranquillity? Will
that which could not be effected by your grenadiers, be accomplished by
your executioners? If you proceed by the forms of law, where is your
evidence? Those who refused to impeach their accomplices, when
transportation only<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>Pg 128</span> was the punishment, will hardly be tempted to
witness against them when death is the penalty. With all due deference
to the noble lords opposite, I think a little investigation, some
previous enquiry, would induce even them to change their purpose. That
most favourite state measure, so marvellously efficacious in many and
recent instances, <i>temporising</i>, would not be without its advantage in
this. When a proposal is made to emancipate or relieve, you hesitate,
you deliberate for years, you temporise and tamper with the minds of
men; but a death-bill must be passed off hand, without a thought of the
consequences."</p>

<p>In reference to his own parliamentary displays, and to this maiden
speech in particular, I find the following remarks in one of his
Journals:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sheridan's liking for me (whether he was not mystifying me, I do not
know, but Lady Caroline Lamb and others told me that he said the same
both before and after he knew me,) was founded upon 'English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers.' He told me that he did not care about poetry, (or
about mine&mdash;at least, any but that poem of mine,) but he was sure, from
that and other symptoms, I should make an orator, if I would but take to
speaking, and grow a parliament man. He never ceased harping upon this
to me to the last; and I remember my old tutor, Dr. Drury, had the same
notion when I was a <i>boy</i>; but it never was my turn of inclination to
try. I spoke once or twice, as all young peers do, as a kind of
introduction into public life; but dissipation, shyness, haughty and
reserved opinions, together with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>Pg 129</span> the short time I lived in England
after my majority (only about five years in all), prevented me from
resuming the experiment. As far as it went, it was not discouraging,
particularly my <i>first</i> speech (I spoke three or four times in all); but
just after it, my poem of Childe Harold was published, and nobody ever
thought about my <i>prose</i> afterwards, nor indeed did I; it became to me a
secondary and neglected object, though I sometimes wonder to myself if I
should have succeeded."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>His immediate impressions with respect to the success of his first
speech may be collected from a letter addressed soon after to Mr.
Hodgson.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 90. TO MR. HODGSON.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"8. St. James's Street, March 5. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Hodgson,</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> are not answerable for reports of speeches in the papers;
they are always given incorrectly, and on this occasion more so
than usual, from the debate in the Commons on the same night. The
Morning Post should have said <i>eighteen years</i>. However, you will
find the speech, as spoken, in the Parliamentary Register, when it
comes out. Lords Holland and Grenville, particularly the latter,
paid me some high compliments in the course of their speeches, as
you may have seen in the papers, and Lords Eldon and Harrowby
answered me. I have had many marvellous eulogies repeated to me
since, in person and by proxy, from divers persons
<i>ministerial</i>&mdash;yea, <i>minis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>Pg 130</span>terial!</i>&mdash;as well as oppositionists; of
them I shall only mention Sir F. Burdett. <i>He</i> says it is the best
speech by a <i>lord</i> since the '<i>Lord</i> knows when,' probably from a
fellow-feeling in the sentiments. Lord H. tells me I shall beat
them all if I persevere; and Lord G. remarked that the construction
of some of my periods are very like <i>Burke's</i>! And so much for
vanity. I spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest
impudence, abused every thing and every body, and put the Lord
Chancellor very much out of humour; and if I may believe what I
hear, have not lost any character by the experiment. As to my
delivery, loud and fluent enough, perhaps a little theatrical. I
could not recognise myself or any one else in the newspapers.</p>

<p>"My poesy comes out on Saturday. Hobhouse is here; I shall tell him
to write. My stone is gone for the present, but I fear is part of
my habit. We <i>all</i> talk of a visit to Cambridge.</p>

<p>"Yours ever, B."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of the same date as the above is the following letter to Lord Holland,
accompanying a copy of his new publication, and written in a tone that
cannot fail to give a high idea of his good feeling and candour.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 91. TO LORD HOLLAND.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"St. James's Street, March 5. 1812.</p>

<p>"My Lord,</p>

<p>"May I request your Lordship to accept a copy of the thing which

<p>that I long for an opportunity to give the lie to the verse that

quarto of the same scribbler. But your Lordship, I am sorry to
observe to-day, is troubled with the gout; if my book can produce a
<i>laugh</i> against itself or the author, it will be of some service.
If it can set you to <i>sleep</i>, the benefit will be yet greater; and
as some facetious personage observed half a century ago, that
'poetry is a mere drug,' I offer you mine as a humble assistant to
the 'eau m&eacute;dicinale.' I trust you will forgive this and all my

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was within two days after his speech in the House of Lords that
Childe Harold appeared<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>Pg 132</span>and the impression which it produced upon
the public was as instantaneous as it has proved deep and lasting. The
permanence of such success genius alone could secure, but to its instant
and enthusiastic burst, other causes, besides the merit of the work,
concurred.</p>

<p>There are those who trace in the peculiar character of Lord Byron's
genius strong features of relationship to the times in which he lived;
who think that the great events which marked the close of the last
century, by giving a new impulse to men's minds, by habituating them to
the daring and the free, and allowing full vent to "the flash and
outbreak of fiery spirits," had led naturally to the production of such
a poet as Byron; and that he was, in short, as much the child and
representative of the Revolution, in poesy, as another great man of the
age, Napoleon, was in statesmanship and warfare. Without going the full
length of this notion, it will, at least, be conceded, that the free
loose which had been given to all the passions and energies of the human
mind, in the great struggle of that period, together with the constant
spectacle of such astounding vicissitudes as were passing, almost daily,
on the theatre of the world, had created, in all minds, and in every
walk of intellect, a taste for strong excitement, which the stimulants
supplied from ordinary sources were insufficient to gratify;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>Pg 133</span>that a
tame deference to established authorities had fallen into disrepute, no
less in literature than in politics, and that the poet who should
breathe into his songs the fierce and passionate spirit of the age, and
assert, untrammelled and unawed, the high dominion of genius, would be
the most sure of an audience toned in sympathy with his strains.</p>

<p>It is true that, to the licence on religious subjects, which revelled
through the first acts of that tremendous drama, a disposition of an
opposite tendency had, for some time, succeeded. Against the wit of the
scoffer, not only piety, but a better taste, revolted; and had Lord
Byron, in touching on such themes in Childe Harold, adopted a tone of
levity or derision, (such as, unluckily, he sometimes afterwards
descended to,) not all the originality and beauty of his work would have
secured for it a prompt or uncontested triumph. As it was, however, the
few dashes of scepticism with which he darkened his strain, far from
checking his popularity, were among those attractions which, as I have
said, independent of all the charms of the poetry, accelerated and
heightened its success. The religious feeling that has sprung up through
Europe since the French revolution&mdash;like the political principles that
have emerged out of the same event&mdash;in rejecting all the licentiousness
of that period, have preserved much of its spirit of freedom and
enquiry; and, among the best fruits of this enlarged and enlightened
piety is the liberty which it disposes men to accord to the opinions,
and even heresies, of others. To persons thus sincerely, and, at the
same time, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>Pg 134</span>lerantly, devout, the spectacle of a great mind, like that
of Byron, labouring in the eclipse of scepticism, could not be otherwise
than an object of deep and solemn interest. If they had already known
what it was to doubt, themselves, they would enter into his fate with
mournful sympathy; while, if safe in the tranquil haven of faith, they
would look with pity on one who was still a wanderer. Besides, erring
and dark as might be his views at that moment, there were circumstances
in his character and fate that gave a hope of better thoughts yet
dawning upon him. From his temperament and youth, there could be little
fear that he was yet hardened in his heresies, and as, for a heart
wounded like his, there was, they knew, but one true source of
consolation, so it was hoped that the love of truth, so apparent in all
he wrote, would, one day, enable him to find it.</p>

<p>Another, and not the least of those causes which concurred with the
intrinsic claims of his genius to give an impulse to the tide of success
that now flowed upon him, was, unquestionably, the peculiarity of his
personal history and character. There had been, in his very first
introduction of himself to the public, a sufficient portion of
singularity to excite strong attention and interest. While all other
youths of talent, in his high station, are heralded into life by the
applauses and anticipations of a host of friends, young Byron stood
forth alone, unannounced by either praise or promise,&mdash;the
representative of an ancient house, whose name, long lost in the gloomy
solitudes of Newstead, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>Pg 135</span> have just awakened from the sleep of
half a century in his person. The circumstances that, in succession,
followed,&mdash;the prompt vigour of his reprisals upon the assailants of his
fame,&mdash;his disappearance, after this achievement, from the scene of his
triumph, without deigning even to wait for the laurels which he had
earned, and his departure on a far pilgrimage, whose limits he left to
chance and fancy,&mdash;all these successive incidents had thrown an air of
adventure round the character of the young poet, which prepared his
readers to meet half-way the impressions of his genius. Instead of
finding him, on a nearer view, fall short of their imaginations, the new
features of his disposition now disclosed to them far outwent, in
peculiarity and interest, whatever they might have preconceived; while
the curiosity and sympathy, awakened by what he suffered to transpire of
his history, were still more heightened by the mystery of his allusions
to much that yet remained untold. The late losses by death which he had
sustained, and which, it was manifest, he most deeply mourned, gave a
reality to the notion formed of him by his admirers which seemed to
authorise them in imagining still more; and what has been said of the
poet Young, that he found out the art of "making the public a party to
his private sorrows," may be, with infinitely more force and truth,
applied to Lord Byron.</p>

<p>On that circle of society with whom he came immediately in contact,
these personal influences acted with increased force, from being
assisted by others, which, to female imaginations especially, would
have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>Pg 136</span> presented a sufficiency of attraction, even without the great
qualities joined with them. His youth,&mdash;the noble beauty of his
countenance, and its constant play of lights and shadows,&mdash;the
gentleness of his voice and manner to women, and his occasional
haughtiness to men,&mdash;the alleged singularities of his mode of life,
which kept curiosity alive and inquisitive,&mdash;all these lesser traits and
habitudes concurred towards the quick spread of his fame; nor can it be
denied that, among many purer sources of interest in his poem, the
allusions which he makes to instances of "<i>successful</i> passion" in his
career<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> were not without their influence on the fancies of that sex,
whose weakness it is to be most easily won by those who come recommended
by the greatest number of triumphs over others.</p>

<p>That his rank was also to be numbered among these extrinsic advantages
appears to have been&mdash;partly, perhaps, from a feeling of modesty at the
time&mdash;his own persuasion. "I may place a great deal of it," said he to
Mr. Dallas, "to my being a lord." It might be supposed that it is only
on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>Pg 137</span> rank inferior to his own such a charm could operate; but this very
speech is, in itself, a proof, that in no class whatever is the
advantage of being noble more felt and appreciated than among nobles
themselves. It was, also, natural that, in that circle, the admiration
of the new poet should be, at least, quickened by the consideration that
he had sprung up among themselves, and that their order had, at length,
produced a man of genius, by whom the arrears of contribution, long due
from them to the treasury of English literature, would be at once fully
and splendidly discharged.</p>

<p>Altogether, taking into consideration the various points I have here
enumerated, it may be asserted, that never did there exist before, and
it is most probable never will exist again, a combination of such vast
mental power and surpassing genius, with so many other of those
advantages and attractions, by which the world is, in general, dazzled
and captivated. The effect was, accordingly, electric;&mdash;his fame had not
to wait for any of the ordinary gradations, but seemed to spring up,
like the palace of a fairy tale, in a night. As he himself briefly
described it in his memoranda,&mdash;"I awoke one morning and found myself
famous." The first edition of his work was disposed of instantly; and,
as the echoes of its reputation multiplied on all sides, "Childe Harold"
and "Lord Byron" became the theme of every tongue. At his door, most of
the leading names of the day presented themselves,&mdash;some of them persons
whom he had much wronged in his Satire, but who now forgot their
resentment in generous<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>Pg 138</span> admiration. From morning till night the most
flattering testimonies of his success crowded his table,&mdash;from the grave
tributes of the statesman and the philosopher down to (what flattered
him still more) the romantic billet of some <i>incognita,</i> or the pressing
note of invitation from some fair leader of fashion; and, in place of
the desert which London had been to him but a few weeks before, he now
not only saw the whole splendid interior of High Life thrown open to
receive him, but found himself, among its illustrious crowds, the most
distinguished object.</p>

<p>The copyright of the poem, which was purchased by Mr. Murray for
600<i>l.</i>, he presented, in the most delicate and unostentatious manner,
to Mr. Dallas<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, saying, at the same time, that he "never would
receive money for his writings;"&mdash;a resolution, the mixed result of
generosity and pride, which he afterwards wisely abandoned, though borne
out by the example of Swift<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and Voltaire, the latter of whom gave
away most of his copyrights to Prault and other booksellers, and
received books, not money, for those he disposed of otherwise. To his
young friend, Mr. Harness, it had been his intention, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>Pg 139</span> first, to
dedicate the work, but, on further consideration, he relinquished his
design; and in a letter to that gentleman (which, with some others, is
unfortunately lost) alleged, as his reason for this change, the
prejudice which, he foresaw, some parts of the poem would raise against
himself, and his fear lest, by any possibility, a share of the odium
might so far extend itself to his friend, as to injure him in the
profession to which he was about to devote himself.</p>

<p>Not long after the publication of Childe Harold, the noble author paid
me a visit, one morning, and, putting a letter into my hands, which he
had just received, requested that I would undertake to manage for him
whatever proceedings it might render necessary. This letter, I found,
had been delivered to him by Mr. Leckie (a gentleman well known by a
work on Sicilian affairs), and came from a once active and popular
member of the fashionable world, Colonel Greville,&mdash;its purport being to
require of his Lordship, as author of "English Bards," &amp;c., such
reparation as it was in his power to make for the injury which, as
Colonel Greville conceived, certain passages in that satire, reflecting
upon his conduct as manager of the Argyle Institution, were calculated
to inflict upon his character. In the appeal of the gallant Colonel,
there were some expressions of rather an angry cast, which Lord Byron,
though fully conscious of the length to which he himself had gone, was
but little inclined to brook, and, on my returning the letter into his
hands, he said, "To such a letter as that there can be but one sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>Pg 140</span>
answer." He agreed, however, to trust the matter entirely to my
discretion, and I had, shortly after, an interview with the friend of
Colonel Greville. By this gentleman, who was then an utter stranger to
me, I was received with much courtesy, and with every disposition to
bring the affair intrusted to us to an amicable issue. On my premising
that the tone of his friend's letter stood in the way of negotiation,
and that some obnoxious expressions which it contained must be removed
before I could proceed a single step towards explanation, he most
readily consented to remove this obstacle. At his request I drew a pen
across the parts I considered objectionable, and he undertook to send me
the letter re-written, next morning. In the mean time I received from
Lord Byron the following paper for my guidance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With regard to the passage on Mr. Way's loss, no unfair play was
hinted at, as may be seen by referring to the book; and it is
expressly added that the <i>managers were ignorant</i> of that
transaction. As to the prevalence of play at the Argyle, it cannot
be denied that there were <i>billiards</i> and <i>dice</i>;&mdash;Lord B. has been
a witness to the use of both at the Argyle Rooms. These, it is
presumed, come under the denomination of play. If play be allowed,
the President of the Institution can hardly complain of being
termed the 'Arbiter of Play,'&mdash;or what becomes of his authority?</p>

<p>"Lord B. has no personal animosity to Colonel Greville. A public
institution, to which he himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>Pg 141</span> was a subscriber, he considered
himself to have a right to notice <i>publicly</i>. Of that institution
Colonel Greville was the avowed director;&mdash;it is too late to enter
into the discussion of its merits or demerits.</p>

<p>"Lord B. must leave the discussion of the reparation, for the real
or supposed injury, to Colonel G.'s friend, and Mr. Moore, the
friend of Lord B.&mdash;begging them to recollect that, while they
consider Colonel G.'s honour, Lord B. must also maintain his own.
If the business can be settled amicably, Lord B. will do as much as
can and ought to be done by a man of honour towards
conciliation;&mdash;if not, he must satisfy Colonel G. in the manner
most conducive to his further wishes."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the morning I received the letter, in its new form, from Mr. Leckie,
with the annexed note.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I found my friend very ill in bed; he has, however, managed to
copy the enclosed, with the alterations proposed. Perhaps you may
wish to see me in the morning; I shall therefore be glad to see you
any time till twelve o'clock. If you rather wish me to call on you,
tell me, and I shall obey your summons. Yours, very truly,</p>

<p>"G.T. LECKIE."</p></div>

<p>With such facilities towards pacification, it is almost needless to add
that there was but little delay in settling the matter amicably.</p>

<p>While upon this subject, I shall avail myself of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>Pg 142</span> opportunity which
it affords of extracting an amusing account given by Lord Byron himself
of some affairs of this description, in which he was, at different
times, employed as mediator.</p>

<p>"I have been called in as mediator, or second, at least twenty times, in
violent quarrels, and have always contrived to settle the business
without compromising the honour of the parties, or leading them to
mortal consequences, and this, too, sometimes in very difficult and
delicate circumstances, and having to deal with very hot and haughty
spirits,&mdash;Irishmen, gamesters, guardsmen, captains, and cornets of
horse, and the like. This was, of course, in my youth, when I lived in
hot-headed company. I have had to carry challenges from gentlemen to
noblemen, from captains to captains, from lawyers to counsellors, and
once from a clergyman to an officer in the Life Guards; but I found the
latter by far the most difficult,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"'to compose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bloody duel without blows,'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the business being about a woman: I must add, too, that I never saw a
<i>woman</i> behave so ill, like a cold-blooded, heartless b&mdash;&mdash; as she
was,&mdash;but very handsome for all that. A certain Susan C * * was she
called. I never saw her but once; and that was to induce her but to say
two words (which in no degree compromised herself), and which would have
had the effect of saving a priest or a lieutenant of cavalry. She would
not say them, and neither N * * nor myself (the son of Sir E. N * *, and
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>Pg 143</span> friend to one of the parties,) could prevail upon her to say them,
though both of us used to deal in some sort with womankind. At last I
managed to quiet the combatants without her talisman, and, I believe, to
her great disappointment: she was the damnedest b&mdash;&mdash; that I ever saw,
and I have seen a great many. Though my clergyman was sure to lose
either his life or his living, he was as warlike as the Bishop of
Beauvais, and would hardly be pacified; but then he was in love, and
that is a martial passion."</p>

<p>However disagreeable it was to find the consequences of his Satire thus
rising up against him in a hostile shape, he was far more embarrassed in
those cases where the retribution took a friendly form. Being now daily
in the habit of meeting and receiving kindnesses from persons who,
either in themselves, or through their relatives, had been wounded by
his pen, he felt every fresh instance of courtesy from such quarters to
be, (as he sometimes, in the strong language of Scripture, expressed
it,) like "heaping coals of fire upon his head." He was, indeed, in a
remarkable degree, sensitive to the kindness or displeasure of those he
lived with; and had he passed a life subject to the immediate influence
of society, it may be doubted whether he ever would have ventured upon
those unbridled bursts of energy in which he at once demonstrated and
abused his power. At the period when he ran riot in his Satire, society
had not yet caught him within its pale; and in the time of his Cains and
Don Juans, he had again broken loose<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>Pg 144</span> from it. Hence, his instinct
towards a life of solitude and independence, as the true element of his
strength. In his own domain of imagination he could defy the whole
world; while, in real life, a frown or smile could rule him. The
facility with which he sacrificed his first volume, at the mere
suggestion of his friend, Mr. Becher, is a strong proof of this
pliableness; and in the instance of Childe Harold, such influence had
the opinions of Mr. Gifford and Mr. Dallas on his mind, that he not only
shrunk from his original design of identifying himself with his hero,
but surrendered to them one of his most favourite stanzas, whose
heterodoxy they had objected to; nor is it too much, perhaps, to
conclude, that had a more extended force of such influence then acted
upon him, he would have consented to omit the sceptical parts of his
poem altogether. Certain it is that, during the remainder of his stay in
England, no such doctrines were ever again obtruded on his readers; and
in all those beautiful creations of his fancy, with which he brightened
that whole period, keeping the public eye in one prolonged gaze of
admiration, both the bitterness and the licence of his impetuous spirit
were kept effectually under control. The world, indeed, had yet to
witness what he was capable of, when emancipated from this restraint.
For, graceful and powerful as were his flights while society had still a
hold of him, it was not till let loose from the leash that he rose into
the true region of his strength; and though almost in proportion to that
strength was, too frequently, his abuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>Pg 145</span> of it, yet so magnificent are
the very excesses of such energy, that it is impossible, even while we
condemn, not to admire.</p>

<p>The occasion by which I have been led into these remarks,&mdash;namely, his
sensitiveness on the subject of his Satire,&mdash;is one of those instances
that show how easily his gigantic spirit could be, if not held down, at
least entangled, by the small ties of society. The aggression of which
he had been guilty was not only past, but, by many of those most
injured, forgiven; and yet,&mdash;highly, it must be allowed, to the credit
of his social feelings,&mdash;the idea of living familiarly and friendlily
with persons, respecting whose character or talents there were such
opinions of his on record, became, at length, insupportable to him; and,
though far advanced in a fifth edition of "English Bards," &amp;c., he came
to the resolution of suppressing the Satire altogether; and orders were
sent to Cawthorn, the publisher, to commit the whole impression to the
flames. At the same time, and from similar motives,&mdash;aided, I rather
think, by a friendly remonstrance from Lord Elgin, or some of his
connections,&mdash;the "Curse of Minerva," a poem levelled against that
nobleman, and already in progress towards publication, was also
sacrificed; while the "Hints from Horace," though containing far less
personal satire than either of the others, shared their fate.</p>

<p>To exemplify what I have said of his extreme sensibility, to the passing
sunshine or clouds of the society in which he lived, I need but cite the
following notes, addressed by him to his friend Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>Pg 146</span> William Bankes,
under the apprehension that this gentleman was, for some reason or
other, displeased with him.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 92. TO MR. WILLIAM BANKES.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"April 20. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Bankes,</p>

<p>"I feel rather hurt (not savagely) at the speech you made to me
last night, and my hope is, that it was only one of your <i>profane</i>
jests. I should be very sorry that any part of my behaviour should
give you cause to suppose that I think higher of myself, or
otherwise of you than I have always done. I can assure you that I
am as much the humblest of your servants as at Trin. Coll.; and if
I have not been at home when you favoured me with a call, the loss
was more mine than yours. In the bustle of buzzing parties, there
is, there can be, no rational conversation; but when I can enjoy
it, there is nobody's I can prefer to your own. Believe me ever
faithfully and most affectionately yours,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 93. TO MR. WILLIAM BANKES.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dear Bankes,</p>

<p>"My eagerness to come to an explanation has, I trust, convinced you
that whatever my unlucky manner might inadvertently be, the change
was as unintentional as (if intended) it would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>Pg 147</span> been
ungrateful. I really was not aware that, while we were together, I
had evinced such caprices; that we were not so much in each other's
company as I could have wished, I well know, but I think so <i>acute</i>
an <i>observer</i> as yourself must have perceived enough to <i>explain
this</i>, without supposing any slight to one in whose society I have
pride and pleasure. Recollect that I do not allude here to
'extended' or 'extending' acquaintances, but to circumstances you
will understand, I think, on a little reflection.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Bankes, do not distress me by supposing that I
can think of you, or you of me, otherwise than I trust we have long
thought. You told me not long ago that my temper was improved, and
I should be sorry that opinion should be revoked. Believe me, your
friendship is of more account to me than all those absurd vanities
in which, I fear, you conceive me to take too much interest. I have
never disputed your superiority, or doubted (seriously) your good
will, and no one shall ever 'make mischief between us' without the
sincere regret on the part of your ever affectionate, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. I shall see you, I hope, at Lady Jersey's. Hobhouse goes
also."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the month of April he was again tempted to try his success in the
House of Lords; and, on the motion of Lord Donoughmore for taking into
consideration the claims of the Irish catholics, delivered his
sentiments strongly in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>Pg 148</span> proposition. His display, on this
occasion, seems to have been less promising than in his first essay. His
delivery was thought mouthing and theatrical, being infected, I take for
granted (having never heard him speak in Parliament), with the same
chanting tone that disfigured his recitation of poetry,&mdash;a tone
contracted at most of the public schools, but more particularly,
perhaps, at Harrow, and encroaching just enough on the boundaries of
song to offend those ears most by which song is best enjoyed and
understood.</p>

<p>On the subject of the negotiations for a change of ministry which took
place during this session, I find the following anecdotes recorded in
his notebook:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the opposition meeting of the peers in 1812, at Lord Grenville's,
when Lord Grey and he read to us the correspondence upon Moira's
negotiation, I sate next to the present Duke of Grafton, and said, 'What
is to be done next?'&mdash;'Wake the Duke of Norfolk' (who was snoring away
near us), replied he: 'I don't think the negotiators have left any thing
else for us to do this turn.'</p>

<p>"In the debate, or rather discussion, afterwards in the House of Lords
upon that very question, I sate immediately behind Lord Moira, who was
extremely annoyed at Grey's speech upon the subject; and, while Grey was
speaking, turned round to me repeatedly, and asked me whether I agreed
with him. It was an awkward question to me who had not heard both sides.
Moira kept repeating to me, 'It was <i>not so</i>, it was so and so,' &amp;c. I
did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>Pg 149</span> know very well what to think, but I sympathised with the
acuteness of his feelings upon the subject."</p>

<p>The subject of the Catholic claims was, it is well known, brought
forward a second time this session by Lord Wellesley, whose motion for a
future consideration of the question was carried by a majority of one.
In reference to this division, another rather amusing anecdote is thus
related.</p>

<p>"Lord * * affects an imitation of two very different Chancellors,
Thurlow and Loughborough, and can indulge in an oath now and then. On
one of the debates on the Catholic question, when we were either equal
or within one (I forget which), I had been sent for in great haste to a
ball, which I quitted, I confess, somewhat reluctantly, to emancipate
five millions of people. I came in late, and did not go immediately into
the body of the House, but stood just behind the woolsack. * * turned
round, and, catching my eye, immediately said to a peer, (who had come
to him for a few minutes on the woolsack, as is the custom of his
friends,) 'Damn them! they'll have it now,&mdash;by G&mdash;&mdash;d! the vote that is
just come in will give it them.'"</p>

<p>During all this time, the impression which he had produced in society,
both as a poet and a man, went on daily increasing; and the facility
with which he gave himself up to the current of fashionable life, and
mingled in all the gay scenes through which it led, showed that the
novelty, at least, of this mode of existence had charms for him, however
he might estimate its pleasures. That sort of vanity which is almost
inseparable from genius, and which consists<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>Pg 150</span> in an extreme sensitiveness
on the subject of self, Lord Byron, I need not say, possessed in no
ordinary degree; and never was there a career in which this sensibility
to the opinions of others was exposed to more constant and various
excitement than that on which he was now entered. I find in a note of my
own to him, written at this period, some jesting allusions to the
"circle of star-gazers" whom I had left around him at some party on the
preceding night;&mdash;and such, in fact, was the flattering ordeal he had to
undergo wherever he went. On these occasions,&mdash;particularly before the
range of his acquaintance had become sufficiently extended to set him
wholly at his ease,&mdash;his air and port were those of one whose better
thoughts were elsewhere, and who looked with melancholy abstraction on
the gay crowd around him. This deportment, so rare in such scenes, and
so accordant with the romantic notions entertained of him, was the
result partly of shyness, and partly, perhaps, of that love of effect
and impression to which the poetical character of his mind naturally
led. Nothing, indeed, could be more amusing and delightful than the
contrast which his manners afterwards, when we were alone, presented to
his proud reserve in the brilliant circle we had just left. It was like
the bursting gaiety of a boy let loose from school, and seemed as if
there was no extent of fun or tricks of which he was not capable.
Finding him invariably thus lively when we were together, I often
rallied him on the gloomy tone of his poetry, as assumed; but his
constant answer was (and I soon ceased to doubt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>Pg 151</span> its truth), that,
though thus merry and full of laughter with those he liked, he was, at
heart, one of the most melancholy wretches in existence.</p>

<p>Among the numerous notes which I received from him at this time,&mdash;some
of them relating to our joint engagements in society, and others to
matters now better forgotten,&mdash;I shall select a few that (as showing his
haunts and habits) may not, perhaps, be uninteresting.</p>

<p>Among the tributes to his fame, this spring, it should have been
mentioned that, at some evening party, he had the honour of being
presented, at that royal personage's own desire, to the Prince Regent.
"The Regent," says Mr. Dallas, "expressed his admiration of Childe
Harold's Pilgrimage, and continued a conversation, which so fascinated
the poet, that had it not been for an accidental deferring of the next
levee, he bade fair to become a visiter at Carlton House, if not a
complete courtier."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>Pg 154</span></p>

<p>After this wise prognostic, the writer adds,&mdash;"I called on him on the
morning for which the levee had been appointed, and found him in a full
dress court suit of clothes, with his fine black hair in powder, which
by no means suited his countenance. I was surprised, as he had not told
me that he should go to court; and it seemed to me as if he thought it
necessary to apologise for his intention, by his observing that he could
not in decency but do it, as the Regent had done him the honour to say
that he hoped to see him soon at Carlton House."</p>

<p>In the two letters that follow we find his own account of the
introduction.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 94. TO LORD HOLLAND.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"June 25. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Lord,</p>

<p>"I must appear very ungrateful, and have, indeed, been very
negligent, but till last night I was not apprised of Lady Holland's
restoration, and I shall call to-morrow to have the satisfaction, I
trust, of hearing that she is well&mdash;I hope that neither politics
nor gout have assailed your Lordship since I last saw you, and that
you also are 'as well as could be expected.'</p>

<p>"The other night, at a ball, I was presented by order to our
gracious Regent, who honoured me with some conversation, and
professed a predilection for poetry.&mdash;I confess it was a most
unexpected honour, and I thought of poor B&mdash;&mdash;-s's adventure, with
some apprehension of a similar blunder, I have now<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>Pg 155</span> great hope, in
the event of Mr. Pye's decease, of 'warbling truth at court,' like
Mr. Mallet of indifferent memory.&mdash;Consider, one hundred marks a
year! besides the wine and the disgrace; but then remorse would
make me drown myself in my own butt before the year's end, or the
finishing of my first dithyrambic.&mdash;So that, after all, I shall not
meditate our laureate's death by pen or poison.</p>

<p>"Will you present my best respects to Lady Holland? and believe me
hers and yours very sincerely."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The second letter, entering much more fully into the particulars of this
interview with Royalty, was in answer, it will be perceived, to some
enquiries which Sir Walter Scott (then Mr. Scott) had addressed to him
on the subject; and the whole account reflects even still more honour on
the Sovereign himself than on the two poets.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 95. TO SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"St. James's Street, July 6. 1812.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"I have just been honoured with your letter.&mdash;I feel sorry that you
should have thought it worth while to notice the 'evil works of my
nonage,' as the thing is suppressed voluntarily, and your
explanation is too kind not to give me pain. The Satire was written
when I was very young and very angry, and fully bent on displaying
my wrath and my wit, and now I am haunted by the ghosts of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>Pg 156</span>
wholesale assertions. I cannot sufficiently thank you for your
praise; and now, waving myself, let me talk to you of the Prince
Regent. He ordered me to be presented to him at a ball; and after
some sayings peculiarly pleasing from royal lips, as to my own
attempts, he talked to me of you and your immortalities: he
preferred you to every bard past and present, and asked which of
your works pleased me most. It was a difficult question. I
answered, I thought the "Lay." He said his own opinion was nearly
similar. In speaking of the others, I told him that I thought you
more particularly the poet of <i>Princes</i>, as <i>they</i> never appeared
more fascinating than in 'Marmion' and the 'Lady of the Lake.' He
was pleased to coincide, and to dwell on the description of your
Jameses as no less royal than poetical. He spoke alternately of
Homer and yourself, and seemed well acquainted with both; so that
(with the exception of the Turks and your humble servant) you were
in very good company. I defy Murray to have exaggerated his Royal
Highness's opinion of your powers, nor can I pretend to enumerate
all he said on the subject; but it may give you pleasure to hear
that it was conveyed in language which would only suffer by my
attempting to transcribe it, and with a tone and taste which gave
me a very high idea of his abilities and accomplishments, which I
had hitherto considered as confined to <i>manners</i>, certainly
superior to those of any living <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>"This interview was accidental. I never went to the levee; for
having seen the courts of Mussulman<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>Pg 157</span> and Catholic sovereigns, my
curiosity was sufficiently allayed; and my politics being as
perverse as my rhymes, I had, in fact, 'no business there.' To be
thus praised by your Sovereign must be gratifying to you; and if
that gratification is not alloyed by the communication being made
through me, the bearer of it will consider himself very fortunately
and sincerely,</p>

<p>"Your obliged and obedient servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Excuse this scrawl, scratched in a great hurry, and just
after a journey."</p></div>

<p>During the summer of this year, he paid visits to some of his noble
friends, and, among others, to the Earl of Jersey and the Marquis of
Lansdowne. "In 1812," he says, "at Middleton (Lord Jersey's), amongst a
goodly company of lords, ladies, and wits, &amp;c., there was (* * *.)<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>"Erskine, too! Erskine was there; good, but intolerable. He jested, he
talked, he did every thing admirably, but then he would be applauded for
the same thing twice over. He would read his own verses, his own
paragraph, and tell his own story again and again; and then the 'Trial
by Jury!!!' I almost wished it abolished, for I sat next him at dinner.
As I had read his published speeches, there was no occasion to repeat
them to me.</p>

<p>"C * * (the fox-hunter), nicknamed '<i>Cheek</i> C * *,'<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>Pg 158</span> and I, sweated the
claret, being the only two who did so. C * *, who loves his bottle, and
had no notion of meeting with a 'bon-vivant' in a scribbler<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, in
making my eulogy to somebody one evening, summed it up in&mdash;'By G&mdash;&mdash;d he
drinks like a man.'</p>

<p>"Nobody drank, however, but C * * and I. To be sure, there was little
occasion, for we swept off what was on the table (a most splendid board,
as may be supposed, at Jersey's) very sufficiently. However, we carried
our liquor discreetly, like the Baron of Bradwardine."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the month of August this year, on the completion of the new Theatre
Royal, Drury Lane, the Committee of Management, desirous of procuring an
Address for the opening of the theatre, took the rather novel mode of
inviting, by an advertisement in the newspapers, the competition of all
the poets of the day towards this object. Though the contributions that
ensued were sufficiently numerous, it did not appear to the Committee
that there was any one among the number worthy of selection. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>Pg 159</span> this
difficulty it occurred to Lord Holland that they could not do better
than have recourse to Lord Byron, whose popularity would give additional
vogue to the solemnity of their opening, and to whose transcendant
claims, as a poet, it was taken for granted, (though without sufficient
allowance, as it proved, for the irritability of the brotherhood,) even
the rejected candidates themselves would bow without a murmur. The first
result of this application to the noble poet will be learned from what
follows.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 96. TO LORD HOLLAND.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Cheltenham, September 10. 1812.</p>

<p>"My dear Lord,</p>

<p>"The lines which I sketched off on your hint are still, or rather
<i>were</i>, in an unfinished state, for I have just committed them to a
flame more decisive than that of Drury. Under all the
circumstances, I should hardly wish a contest with
Philo-drama&mdash;Philo-Drury&mdash;Asbestos, H * *, and all the anonymes and
synonymes of Committee candidates. Seriously, I think you have a
chance of something much better; for prologuising is not my forte,
and, at all events, either my pride or my modesty won't let me
incur the hazard of having my rhymes buried in next month's
Magazine, under 'Essays on the Murder of Mr. Perceval,' and 'Cures
for the Bite of a Mad Dog,' as poor Goldsmith complained of the
fate of far superior performances.</p>

<p>"I am still sufficiently interested to wish to know the successful
candidate; and, amongst so many, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>Pg 160</span> have no doubt some will be
excellent, particularly in an age when writing verse is the easiest
of all attainments.</p>

<p>"I cannot answer your intelligence with the 'like comfort,' unless,
as you are deeply theatrical, you may wish to hear of Mr. * *,
whose acting is, I fear, utterly inadequate to the London
engagement into which the managers of Covent Garden have lately
entered. His figure is fat, his features flat, his voice
unmanageable, his action ungraceful, and, as Diggory says, 'I defy
him to <i>ex</i>tort that d&mdash;&mdash;d muffin face of his into madness.' I was
very sorry to see him in the character of the 'Elephant on the
slack rope;' for, when I last saw him, I was in raptures with his
performance. But then I was sixteen&mdash;an age to which all London
condescended to subside. After all, much better judges have
admired, and may again; but I venture to 'prognosticate a prophecy'
(see the Courier) that he will not succeed.</p>

<p>"So, poor dear Rogers has stuck fast on 'the brow of the mighty
Helvellyn'&mdash;I hope not for ever. My best respects to Lady H.:&mdash;her
departure, with that of my other friends, was a sad event for me,
now reduced to a state of the most cynical solitude. 'By the waters
of Cheltenham I sat down and <i>drank</i>, when I remembered thee, oh
Georgiana Cottage! As for our <i>harps</i>, we hanged them up upon the
willows that grew thereby. Then they said, Sing us a song of Drury
Lane,' &amp;c.;&mdash;but I am dumb and dreary as the Israelites. The waters
have disordered me to my heart's content&mdash;you <i>were</i> right, as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>Pg 161</span>
always are. Believe me ever your obliged and affectionate servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The request of the Committee for his aid having been, still more
urgently, repeated, he, at length, notwithstanding the difficulty and
invidiousness of the task, from his strong wish to oblige Lord Holland,
consented to undertake it; and the quick succeeding notes and letters,
which he addressed, during the completion of the Address, to his noble
friend, afford a proof (in conjunction with others of still more
interest, yet to be cited) of the pains he, at this time, took in
improving and polishing his first conceptions, and the importance he
wisely attached to a judicious choice of epithets as a means of
enriching both the music and the meaning of his verse. They also
show,&mdash;what, as an illustration of his character, is even still more
valuable,&mdash;the exceeding pliancy and good humour with which he could
yield to friendly suggestions and criticisms; nor can it be questioned,
I think, but that the docility thus invariably exhibited by him, on
points where most poets are found to be tenacious and irritable, was a
quality natural to his disposition, and such as might have been turned
to account in far more important matters, had he been fortunate enough
to meet with persons capable of understanding and guiding him.</p>

<p>The following are a few of those hasty notes, on the subject of the
Address, which I allude to:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>Pg 162</span></p>

not the cunning. When I began 'Childe Harold,' I had never tried
Spenser's measure, and now I cannot scribble in any other.</p>

enough to retain in memory, or on paper, the thing they have been
good enough to adopt? By the by, the circumstances of the case
should make the Committee less 'avidus glorias,' for all praise of
them would look plaguy suspicious. If necessary to be stated at
all, the simple facts bear them out. They surely had a right to act
as they pleased. My sole object is one which, I trust, my whole
conduct has shown; viz. that I did nothing insidious&mdash;sent in no
Address <i>whatever</i>&mdash;but, when applied to, did my best for them and
myself; but, above all, that there was no undue partiality, which
will be what the rejected will endeavour to make out.
Fortunately&mdash;most fortunately&mdash;I sent in no lines on the occasion.
For I am sure that had they, in that case, been preferred, it would
have been asserted that <i>I</i> was known, and owed the preference to
private friendship. This is what we shall probably have to
encounter; but, if once spoken and approved, we sha'n't be much
embarrassed by their brilliant conjectures; and, as to criticism,
an <i>old</i> author, like an old bull, grows cooler (or ought) at every
baiting.</p>

transaction inevitably tends to a good deal of discussion. Murray
tells me there are myriads of ironical Addresses ready&mdash;<i>some</i>, in
imitation of what is called <i>my style</i>. If they are as good as the
Probationary Odes, or Hawkins's Pipe of Tobacco, it will not be bad

<p><b>LETTER 108. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Cheltenham, Sept. 14. 1812.</p>

<p>"The parcels contained some letters and verses, all but one
anonymous and complimentary, and very anxious for my conversion
from certain infidelities into which my good-natured correspondents
conceive me to have fallen. The books were presents of a
<i>convertible</i> kind. Also, 'Christian Knowledge' and the 'Bioscope,'
a religious Dial of Life explained;&mdash;and to the author of the
former (Cadell, publisher,) I beg you will forward my best thanks
for his letter, his present, and, above all, his good intentions.
The 'Bioscope' contained a MS. copy of very excellent verses, from
whom I know not, but evidently the composition of some one in the
habit of writing, and of writing well. I do not know if he be the
author of the 'Bioscope' which accompanied them; but whoever he is,
if you can discover him, thank him from me most heartily. The other
letters were from ladies, who are welcome to convert me when they
please; and if I can discover them, and they be young, as they say
they are, I could convince them perhaps of my devotion. I had also
a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>Pg 171</span> Mr. Walpole on matters of this world, which I have
answered.</p>

<p>"So you are Lucien's publisher? I am promised an interview with
him, and think I shall ask <i>you</i> for a letter of introduction, as
'the gods have made him poetical.' From whom could it come with a
better grace than from <i>his</i> publisher and mine? Is it not somewhat
treasonable in you to have to do with a relative of the 'direful
foe,' as the Morning Post calls his brother?</p>

<p>"But my book on 'Diet and Regimen,' where is it? I thirst for
Scott's Rokeby; let me have your first-begotten copy. The
Anti-jacobin Review is all very well, and not a bit worse than the
Quarterly, and at least less harmless. By the by, have you secured
my books? I want all the Reviews, at least the critiques,
quarterly, monthly, &amp;c., Portuguese and English, extracted, and
bound up in one volume for my <i>old age</i>; and pray, sort my Romaic
books, and get the volumes lent to Mr. Hobhouse&mdash;he has had them
now a long time. If any thing occurs, you will favour me with a
line, and in winter we shall be nearer neighbours.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I was applied to, to write the Address for Drury Lane, but
the moment I heard of the contest, I gave up the idea of contending
against all Grub Street, and threw a few thoughts on the subject
into the fire. I did this out of respect to you, being sure you
would have turned off any of your authors who had entered the lists
with such scurvy competitors. To triumph would have been no glory;
and to have been defeated&mdash;'sdeath!&mdash;I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>Pg 172</span> have choked myself,

nothing to do with it, upon <i>my honour</i>."</p></div>

<p>"My dear Bankes,</p>

<p>"When you point out to one how people can be intimate at the
distance of some seventy leagues, I will plead guilty to your
charge, and accept your farewell, but not <i>wittingly</i>, till you
give me some better reason than my silence, which merely proceeded
from a notion founded on your own declaration of <i>old</i>, that you
hated writing and receiving letters. Besides, how was I to find out
a man of many residences? If I had addressed you <i>now</i>, it had been
to your borough, where I must have conjectured you were amongst
your constituents. So now, in despite of Mr. N. and Lady W., you
shall be as 'much better' as the Hexham post-office will allow me
to make you. I do assure you I am much indebted to you for thinking
of me at all, and can't spare you even from amongst the
superabundance of friends with whom you suppose me surrounded.</p>

<p>"You heard that Newstead<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> is sold&mdash;the sum<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>Pg 173</span> 140,000<i>l.</i>; sixty
to remain in mortgage on the estate for three years, paying
interest, of course. Rochdale is also likely to do well&mdash;so my
worldly matters are mending. I have been here some time drinking
the waters, simply because there are waters to drink, and they are
very medicinal, and sufficiently disgusting. In a few days I set
out for Lord Jersey's, but return here, where I am quite alone, go
out very little, and enjoy in its fullest extent the 'dolce far
niente.' What you are about, I cannot guess, even from your
date;&mdash;not dauncing to the sound of the gitourney in the Halls of
the Lowthers? one of whom is here, ill, poor thing, with a
phthisic. I heard that you passed through here (at the sordid inn
where I first alighted) the very day before I arrived in these
parts. We had a very pleasant set here; at first the Jerseys,
Melbournes, Cowpers, and Hollands, but all gone; and the only
persons I know are the Rawdons and Oxfords, with some later
acquaintances of less brilliant descent.</p>

<p>"But I do not trouble them much; and as for your rooms and your
assemblies, 'they are not dreamed of in our philosophy!!'&mdash;Did you
read of a sad accident in the Wye t' other day? a dozen drowned, and
Mr. Rossoe, a corpulent gentleman, preserved by a boat-hook or an
eel-spear, begged, when he heard his wife was
saved&mdash;no&mdash;<i>lost</i>&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>Pg 174</span> be thrown in again!!&mdash;as if he could not
have thrown himself in, had he wished it; but this passes for a
trait of sensibility. What strange beings men are, in and out of
the Wye!</p>

<p>"I have to ask you a thousand pardons for not fulfilling some
orders before I left town; but if you knew all the cursed
entanglements I <i>had</i> to wade through, it would be unnecessary to
beg your forgiveness.&mdash;When will Parliament (the new one)
meet?&mdash;in sixty days, on account of Ireland, I presume: the Irish
election will demand a longer period for completion than the
constitutional allotment. Yours, of course, is safe, and all your
side of the question. Salamanca is the ministerial watchword, and
all will go well with you. I hope you will speak more frequently, I
am sure at least you <i>ought</i>, and it will be expected. I see
Portman means to stand again. Good night.</p>

'Waltzing' shall be prepared. It is rather above two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>Pg 180</span>
lines, with an introductory Letter to the Publisher. I think of
publishing, with Childe Harold, the opening lines of the 'Curse of
Minerva,' as far as the first speech of Pallas,&mdash;because some of
the readers like that part better than any I have ever written, and
as it contains nothing to affect the subject of the subsequent
portion, it will find a place as a <i>Descriptive Fragment</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>plate</i> is <i>broken</i>? between ourselves, it was unlike the

would have been no recommendation to the book. I am sure Sanders
would not have <i>survived</i> the engraving. By the by, the <i>picture</i>
may remain with <i>you</i> or <i>him</i> (which you please), till my return.
The <i>one</i> of two remaining copies is at your service till I can

<p>"On my return here from Lord Oxford's, I found your obliging note,
and will thank you to retain the letters, and any other subsequent
ones to the same address, till I arrive in town to claim them,
which will probably be in a few days. I have in charge a curious
and very long MS. poem, written by Lord Brooke (the <i>friend</i> of Sir
<i>Philip Sidney</i>), which I wish to submit to the inspection of Mr.
Gifford, with the following queries:&mdash;first, whether it has ever
been published, and, secondly (if not), whether it is worth
publication? It is from Lord Oxford's library, and must have
escaped or been overlooked amongst the MSS. of the Harleian
Miscellany. The writing is Lord Brooke's, except a different hand
towards the close. It is very long, and in the six-line stanza. It
is not for me to hazard an opinion upon its merits; but I would
take the liberty, if not too troublesome, to submit it to Mr.
Gifford's judgment, which, from his excellent edition of Massinger,
I should conceive to be as decisive on the writings of that age as
on those of our own.</p>

larcenous? I think the ceremony of leave might have been asked,
though I have no objection to the thing itself; and leave the
'hundred and eleven' to tire themselves with 'base comparisons.' I
should think the ingenuous public tolerably sick of the subject,
and, except the Parodies, I have not interfered, nor shall; indeed
I did not know that Dr. Busby had published his Apologetical Letter
and Postscript, or I should have recalled them. But, I confess, I
looked upon his conduct in a different light before its appearance.
I see some mountebank has taken Alderman Birch's name to vituperate
Dr. Busby; he had much better have pilfered his pastry, which I

pretty little girl you saw the other day<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>Pg 187</span> without her name,
and merely as a model for some sketch connected with the subject. I
would also have the portrait (which you saw to-day) of the friend who is
mentioned in the text at the close of Canto 1st, and in the
notes,&mdash;which are subjects sufficient to authorise that addition."</p>

<p>Early in the spring he brought out, anonymously, his poem on Waltzing,
which, though full of very lively satire, fell so far short of what was
now expected from him by the public, that the disavowal of it, which, as
we see by the following letter, he thought right to put forth, found
ready credence:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 120. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"April 21. 1813.</p>

<p>"I shall be in town by Sunday next, and will call and have some
conversation on the subject of Westall's designs. I am to sit to
him for a picture at the request of a friend of mine, and as
Sanders's is not a good one, you will probably prefer the other. I
wish you to have Sanders's taken down and sent to my lodgings
immediately&mdash;before my arrival. I hear that a certain malicious
publication on Waltzing is attributed to me. This report, I
suppose, you will take care to contradict, as the author, I am
sure, will not like that I should wear his cap and bells. Mr.
Hobhouse's quarto will be out immediately; pray send to the author
for an early copy, which I wish to take abroad with me.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I see the Examiner threatens some observations upon you next
week. What can you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>Pg 188</span> done to share the wrath which has
heretofore been principally expended upon the Prince? I presume all
your Scribleri will be drawn up in battle array in defence of the
modern Tonson&mdash;Mr. Bucke, for instance.</p>

<p>"Send in my account to Bennet Street, as I wish to settle it before
sailing."</p></div>

<p>In the month of May appeared his wild and beautiful "Fragment," <i>The
Giaour</i>;&mdash;and though, in its first flight from his hands, some of the
fairest feathers of its wing were yet wanting, the public hailed this
new offspring of his genius with wonder and delight. The idea of writing
a poem in fragments had been suggested to him by the <i>Columbus</i> of Mr.
Rogers; and, whatever objections may lie against such a plan in general,
it must be allowed to have been well suited to the impatient temperament
of Byron, as enabling him to overleap those mechanical difficulties,
which, in a regular narrative, embarrass, if not chill, the
poet,&mdash;leaving it to the imagination of his readers to fill up the
intervals between those abrupt bursts of passion in which his chief
power lay. The story, too, of the poem possessed that stimulating charm
for him, almost indispensable to his fancy, of being in some degree
connected with himself,&mdash;an event in which he had been personally
concerned, while on his travels, having supplied the groundwork on which
the fiction was founded. After the appearance of The Giaour, some
incorrect statement of this romantic incident having got into
circulation, the noble author requested of his friend,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>Pg 189</span> the Marquis of
Sligo, who had visited Athens soon after it happened, to furnish him
with his recollections on the subject; and the following is the answer
which Lord Sligo returned:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Albany, Monday, August 31. 1813.</p>

<p>"My dear Byron,</p>

<p>"You have requested me to tell you all that I heard at Athens about
the affair of that girl who was so near being put an end to while
you were there; you have asked me to mention every circumstance, in
the remotest degree relating to it, which I heard. In compliance
with your wishes, I write to you all I heard, and I cannot imagine
it to be very far from the fact, as the circumstance happened only
a day or two before I arrived at Athens, and, consequently, was a
matter of common conversation at the time.</p>

<p>"The new governor, unaccustomed to have the same intercourse with
the Christians as his predecessor, had of course the barbarous
Turkish ideas with regard to women. In consequence, and in
compliance with the strict letter of the Mahommedan law, he ordered
this girl to be sewed up in a sack, and thrown into the sea,&mdash;as
is, indeed, quite customary at Constantinople. As you were
returning from bathing in the Piraeus, you met the procession going
down to execute the sentence of the Waywode on this unfortunate
girl. Report continues to say, that on finding out what the object
of their journey was, and who was the miserable sufferer, you
immediately interfered; and on some delay in obeying your orders,
you were obliged to inform the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>Pg 190</span> leader of the escort, that force
should make him comply;&mdash;that, on farther hesitation, you drew a
pistol, and told him, that if he did not immediately obey your
orders, and come back with you to the Aga's house, you would shoot
him dead. On this, the man turned about and went with you to the
governor's house; here you succeeded, partly by personal threats,
and partly by bribery and entreaty, to procure her pardon on
condition of her leaving Athens. I was told that you then conveyed
her in safety to the convent, and despatched her off at night to
Thebes, where she found a safe asylum. Such is the story I heard,
as nearly as I can recollect it at present. Should you wish to ask
me any further questions about it, I shall be very ready and
willing to answer them. I remain, my dear Byron,</p>

<p>"Yours, very sincerely,</p>

<p>"SLIGO.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will hardly be able to read this scrawl; but I am
so hurried with the preparations for my journey, that you must
excuse it."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of the prodigal flow of his fancy, when its sources were once opened on
any subject, The Giaour affords one of the most remarkable
instances,&mdash;this poem having accumulated under his hand, both in
printing and through successive editions, till from four hundred lines,
of which it consisted in his first copy, it at present amounts to nearly
fourteen hundred. The plan, indeed, which he had adopted, of a series of
fragments,&mdash;a set of "orient pearls at random strung,"&mdash;left him free to
introduce,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>Pg 191</span> without reference to more than the general complexion of his
story, whatever sentiments or images his fancy, in its excursions, could
collect; and how little fettered he was by any regard to connection in
these additions, appears from a note which accompanied his own copy of
the paragraph commencing "Fair clime, where every season smiles,"&mdash;in
which he says, "I have not yet fixed the place of insertion for the
following lines, but will, when I see you&mdash;as I have no copy."</p>

<p>Even into this new passage, rich as it was at first, his fancy
afterwards poured a fresh infusion,&mdash;the whole of its most picturesque
portion, from the line "For there, the Rose o'er crag or vale," down to
"And turn to groans his roundelay," having been suggested to him during
revision. In order to show, however, that though so rapid in the first
heat of composition, he formed no exception to that law which imposes
labour as the price of perfection, I shall here extract a few verses
from his original draft of this paragraph, by comparing which with the
form they wear at present<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> we may learn to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>Pg 192</span> appreciate the value of
these after-touches of the master.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair clime! where <i>ceaseless summer</i> smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Benignant o'er those blessed isles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, seen from far Colonna's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make glad the heart that hails the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>give</i> to loneliness delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There <i>shine the bright abodes ye seek,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like dimples upon Ocean's cheek,&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So smiling round the waters lave</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>These Edens of the eastern wave.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or if, at times, the transient breeze</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break the <i>smooth</i> crystal of the seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or <i>brush</i> one blossom from the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How <i>grateful</i> is the gentle air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wakes and wafts the <i>fragrance</i> there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the other passages added to this edition (which was either the
third or fourth, and between which and the first there intervened but
about six weeks) was that most beautiful and melancholy illustration of
the lifeless aspect of Greece, beginning "He who hath bent him o'er the
dead,"&mdash;of which the most gifted critic of our day<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> has justly
pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>Pg 193</span>nounced, that "it contains an image more true, more mournful, and
more exquisitely finished, than any we can recollect in the whole
compass of poetry."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> To the same edition also were added, among other
accessions of wealth<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, those lines, "The cygnet proudly walks the
water," and the impassioned verses, "My memory now is but the tomb."</p>

<p>On my rejoining him in town this spring, I found the enthusiasm about
his writings and himself, which I left so prevalent, both in the world
of literature and in society, grown, if any thing, still more general
and intense. In the immediate circle, perhaps, around him, familiarity
of intercourse might have begun to produce its usual disenchanting
effects. His own liveliness and unreserve, on a more intimate
acquaintance, would not be long in dispelling that charm of poetic
sadness, which to the eyes of distant observers hung about him; while
the romantic notions, connected by some of his fair readers with those
past and nameless loves alluded to in his poems, ran some risk of
abatement from too near an ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>Pg 194</span>quaintance with the supposed objects of
his fancy and fondness at present. A poet's mistress should remain, if
possible, as imaginary a being to others, as, in most of the attributes
he clothes her with, she has been to himself;&mdash;the reality, however
fair, being always sure to fall short of the picture which a too lavish
fancy has drawn of it. Could we call up in array before us all the
beauties whom the love of poets has immortalised, from the high-born
dame to the plebeian damsel,&mdash;from the Lauras and Sacharissas down to
the Cloes and Jeannies,&mdash;we should, it is to be feared, sadly unpeople
our imaginations of many a bright tenant that poesy has lodged there,
and find, in more than one instance, our admiration of the faith and
fancy of the worshipper increased by our discovery of the worthlessness
of the idol.</p>

<p>But, whatever of its first romantic impression the personal character of
the poet may, from such causes, have lost in the circle he most
frequented, this disappointment of the imagination was far more than
compensated by the frank, social, and engaging qualities, both of
disposition and manner, which, on a nearer intercourse, he disclosed, as
well as by that entire absence of any literary assumption or pedantry,
which entitled him fully to the praise bestowed by Sprat upon Cowley,
that few could "ever discover he was a great poet by his discourse."
While thus, by his intimates, and those who had got, as it were, behind
the scenes of his fame, he was seen in his true colours, as well of
weakness as of amiableness, on strangers and such as were out of this
immediate circle, the spell of his poetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>Pg 195</span> character still continued
to operate; and the fierce gloom and sternness of his imaginary
personages were, by the greater number of them, supposed to belong, not
only as regarded mind, but manners, to himself. So prevalent and
persevering has been this notion, that, in some disquisitions on his
character published since his death, and containing otherwise many just
and striking views, we find, in the professed portrait drawn of him,
such features as the following:&mdash;"Lord Byron had a stern, direct, severe
mind: a sarcastic, disdainful, gloomy temper. He had no light sympathy
with heartless cheerfulness;&mdash;upon the surface was sourness, discontent,
displeasure, ill will. Beneath all this weight of clouds and
darkness<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the sort of double aspect which he thus presented, as viewed by the
world and by his friends, he was himself fully aware; and it not only
amused him, but, as a proof of the versatility of his powers, flattered
his pride. He was, indeed, as I have already remarked, by no means
insensible or inattentive to the effect he produced personally on
society; and though the brilliant station he had attained, since the
commencement of my acquaintance with him, made not the slightest
alteration in the unaffectedness of his private intercourse, I could
perceive, I thought, with reference to the external world, some slight
changes in his conduct, which seemed indicative of the effects of his
celebrity upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>Pg 196</span> him. Among other circumstances, I observed that, whether
from shyness of the general gaze, or from a notion, like Livy's, that
men of eminence should not too much familiarise the public to their
persons<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, he avoided showing himself in the mornings, and in crowded
places, much more than was his custom when we first became acquainted.
The preceding year, before his name had grown "so rife and celebrated,"
we had gone together to the exhibition at Somerset House, and other such
places<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>; and the true reason, no doubt, of his present reserve, in
abstaining from all such miscellaneous haunts, was the sensitiveness, so
often referred to, on the subject of his lameness,&mdash;a feeling which the
curiosity of the public eye, now attracted to this infirmity by his
fame, could not fail, he knew, to put rather painfully to the proof.</p>

<p>Among the many gay hours we passed together this spring, I remember
particularly the wild flow of his spirits one evening, when we had
accompanied Mr. Rogers home from some early assembly, and when Lord
Byron, who, according to his frequent custom, had not dined for the last
two days, found<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>Pg 197</span> his hunger no longer governable, and called aloud for
"something to eat." Our repast,&mdash;of his own choosing,&mdash;was simple bread
and cheese; and seldom have I partaken of so joyous a supper. It
happened that our host had just received a presentation copy of a volume
of poems, written professedly in imitation of the old English writers,
and containing, like many of these models, a good deal that was striking
and beautiful, mixed up with much that was trifling, fantastic, and
absurd. In our mood, at the moment, it was only with these latter
qualities that either Lord Byron or I felt disposed to indulge
ourselves; and, in turning over the pages, we found, it must be owned,
abundant matter for mirth. In vain did Mr. Rogers, in justice to the
author, endeavour to direct our attention to some of the beauties of the
work:&mdash;it suited better our purpose (as is too often the case with more
deliberate critics) to pounce only on such passages as ministered to the
laughing humour that possessed us. In this sort of hunt through the
volume, we at length lighted on the discovery that our host, in addition
to his sincere approbation of some of its contents, had also the motive
of gratitude for standing by its author, as one of the poems was a warm
and, I need not add, well-deserved panegyric on himself. We were,
however, too far gone in nonsense for even this eulogy, in which we both
so heartily agreed, to stop us. The opening line of the poem was, as
well as I can recollect, "When Rogers o'er this labour bent;" and Lord
Byron undertook to read it aloud;&mdash;but he found it impossible to get
beyond the first two words. Our laughter had now<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>Pg 198</span> increased to such a
pitch that nothing could restrain it. Two or three times he began; but
no sooner had the words "When Rogers" passed his lips, than our fit
burst forth afresh,&mdash;till even Mr. Rogers himself, with all his feeling
of our injustice, found it impossible not to join us; and we were, at
last, all three, in such a state of inextinguishable laughter, that, had
the author himself been of the party, I question much whether he could
have resisted the infection.</p>

<p>A day or two after, Lord Byron sent me the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dear Moore,</p>

<p>"'When Rogers' must not see the enclosed, which I send for your

<p>The mention which he makes of Sheridan in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>Pg 201</span> note just cited affords a
fit opportunity of producing, from one of his Journals, some particulars
which he has noted down respecting this extraordinary man, for whose
talents he entertained the most unbounded admiration,&mdash;rating him, in
natural powers, far above all his great political contemporaries.</p>

<p>"In society I have met Sheridan frequently: he was superb! He had a sort
of liking for me, and never attacked me, at least to my face, and he did
every body else&mdash;high names, and wits, and orators, some of them poets
also. I have seen him cut up Whitbread, quiz Madame de Sta&euml;l, annihilate
Colman, and do little less by some others (whose names, as friends, I
set not down) of good fame and ability.</p>

<p>"The last time I met him was, I think, at Sir Gilbert Heathcote's, where
he was as quick as ever&mdash;no, it was not the last time; the last time was
at Douglas Kinnaird's.</p>

<p>"I have met him in all places and parties,&mdash;at Whitehall with the
Melbournes, at the Marquis of Tavistock's, at Robins's the auctioneer's,
at Sir Humphrey Davy's, at Sam Rogers's,&mdash;in short, in most kinds of
company, and always found him very convivial and delightful.</p>

<p>"I have seen Sheridan weep two or three times. It may be that he was
maudlin; but this only renders it more impressive, for who would see</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From Marlborough's eyes the tears of dotage flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Swift expire a driveller and a show?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Once I saw him cry at Robins's the auctioneer's,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>Pg 202</span> after a splendid
dinner, full of great names and high spirits. I had the honour of
sitting next to Sheridan. The occasion of his tears was some observation
or other upon the subject of the sturdiness of the Whigs in resisting
office and keeping to their principles: Sheridan turned round:&mdash;'Sir, it
is easy for my Lord G. or Earl G. or Marquis B. or Lord H. with
thousands upon thousands a year, some of it either <i>presently</i> derived,
or <i>inherited</i> in sinecure or acquisitions from the public money, to
boast of their patriotism and keep aloof from temptation; but they do
not know from what temptation those have kept aloof who had equal pride,
at least equal talents, and not unequal passions, and nevertheless knew
not in the course of their lives what it was to have a shilling of their
own.' And in saying this he wept.</p>

<p>"I have more than once heard him say, 'that he never had a shilling of
his own.' To be sure, he contrived to extract a good many of other
people's.</p>

<p>"In 1815, I had occasion to visit my lawyer in Chancery Lane, he was
with Sheridan. After mutual greetings, &amp;c., Sheridan retired first.
Before recurring to my own business, I could not help enquiring <i>that</i>
of Sheridan. 'Oh,' replied the attorney, 'the usual thing! to stave off
an action from his wine-merchant, my client.'&mdash;'Well,' said I, 'and what
do you mean to do?'&mdash;'Nothing at all for the present,' said he: 'would
you have us proceed against old Sherry? what would be the use of it?'
and here he began laughing, and going over Sheridan's good gifts of
conversation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>Pg 203</span></p>

<p>"Now, from personal experience, I can vouch that my attorney is by no
means the tenderest of men, or particularly accessible to any kind of
impression out of the statute or record; and yet Sheridan, in half an
hour, had found the way to soften and seduce him in such a manner, that
I almost think he would have thrown his client (an honest man, with all
the laws, and some justice, on his side) out of the window, had he come
in at the moment.</p>

<p>"Such was Sheridan! he could soften an attorney! There has been nothing
like it since the days of Orpheus.</p>

<p>"One day I saw him take up his own 'Monody on Garrick.' He lighted upon
the Dedication to the Dowager Lady * *. On seeing it, he flew into a
rage, and exclaimed, 'that it must be a forgery, that he had never
dedicated any thing of his to such a d&mdash;&mdash;d canting,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c&mdash;and so
went on for half an hour abusing his own dedication, or at least the
object of it. If all writers were equally sincere, it would be
ludicrous.</p>

<p>"He told me that, on the night of the grand success of his School for
Scandal, he was knocked down and put into the watch-house for making a
row in the street, and being found intoxicated by the watchmen.</p>

<p>"When dying, he was requested to undergo 'an operation.' He replied,
that he had already submitted to two, which were enough for one man's
lifetime. Being asked what they were, he answered, 'having his hair cut,
and sitting for his picture.'</p>

<p>"I have met George Colman occasionally, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>Pg 204</span> thought him extremely
pleasant and convivial. Sheridan's humour, or rather wit, was always
saturnine, and sometimes savage; he never laughed, (at least that <i>I</i>
saw, and I watched him,) but Colman did. If I had to <i>choose</i>, and could
not have both at a time, I should say, 'Let me begin the evening with
Sheridan, and finish it with Colman.' Sheridan for dinner, Colman for
supper; Sheridan for claret or port, but Colman for every thing, from
the madeira and champagne at dinner, the claret with a <i>layer</i> of <i>port</i>
between the glasses, up to the punch of the night, and down to the grog,
or gin and water, of daybreak;&mdash;all these I have threaded with both the
same. Sheridan was a grenadier company of life-guards, but Colman a
whole regiment&mdash;of <i>light infantry</i>, to be sure, but still a regiment."</p>

<p>It was at this time that Lord Byron became acquainted (and, I regret to
have to add, partly through my means) with Mr. Leigh Hunt, the editor of
a well-known weekly journal, the Examiner. This gentleman I had myself
formed an acquaintance with in the year 1811, and, in common with a
large portion of the public, entertained a sincere admiration of his
talents and courage as a journalist. The interest I took in him
personally had been recently much increased by the manly spirit, which
he had displayed throughout a prosecution instituted against himself and
his brother, for a libel that had appeared in their paper on the Prince
Regent, and in consequence of which they were both sentenced to
imprisonment for two years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>Pg 205</span> It will be recollected that there existed
among the Whig party, at this period, a strong feeling of indignation at
the late defection from themselves and their principles of the
illustrious personage who had been so long looked up to as the friend
and patron of both. Being myself, at the time, warmly&mdash;perhaps
intemperately&mdash;under the influence of this feeling, I regarded the fate
of Mr. Hunt with more than common interest, and, immediately on my
arrival in town, paid him a visit in his prison. On mentioning the
circumstance, soon after, to Lord Byron, and describing my surprise at
the sort of luxurious comforts with which I had found the "wit in the
dungeon" surrounded,&mdash;his trellised flower-garden without, and his
books, busts, pictures, and piano-forte within,&mdash;the noble poet, whose
political view of the case coincided entirely with my own, expressed a
strong wish to pay a similar tribute of respect to Mr. Hunt, and
accordingly, a day or two after, we proceeded for that purpose to the
prison. The introduction which then took place was soon followed by a
request from Mr. Hunt that we would dine with him; and the noble poet
having good-naturedly accepted the invitation, Horsemonger Lane gaol
had, in the month of June, 1813, the honour of receiving Lord Byron, as
a guest, within its walls.</p>

<p>On the morning of our first visit to the journalist, I received from
Lord Byron the following lines written, it will be perceived, the night
before:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>Pg 206</span></p>

<p>Our day in the prison was, if not agreeable, at least novel and odd. I
had, for Lord Byron's sake, stipulated with our host beforehand, that
the party should be, as much as possible, confined to ourselves; and, as
far as regarded dinner, my wishes had been attended to;&mdash;there being
present, besides a member or two of Mr. Hunt's own family, no other
stranger, that I can recollect, but Mr. Mitchell, the ingenious
translator of Aristophanes. Soon after dinner, however, there dropped in
some of our host's literary friends, who, being utter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>Pg 207</span> strangers to Lord
Byron and myself, rather disturbed the ease into which we were all
settling. Among these, I remember, was Mr. John Scott,&mdash;the writer,
afterwards, of some severe attacks on Lord Byron; and it is painful to
think that, among the persons then assembled round the poet, there
should have been <i>one</i> so soon to step forth the assailant of his living
fame, while <i>another</i>, less manful, was to reserve the cool venom for
his grave.</p>

<p>On the 2d of June, in presenting a petition to the House of Lords, he
made his third and last appearance as an orator, in that assembly. In
his way home from the House that day, he called, I remember, at my
lodgings, and found me dressing in a very great hurry for dinner. He
was, I recollect, in a state of most humorous exaltation after his
display, and, while I hastily went on with my task in the dressing-room,
continued to walk up and down the adjoining chamber, spouting forth for
me, in a sort of mock heroic voice, detached sentences of the speech he
had just been delivering. "I told them," he said, "that it was a most
flagrant violation of the Constitution&mdash;that, if such things were
permitted, there was an end of English freedom, and that &mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"But
what was this dreadful grievance?" I asked, interrupting him in his
eloquence.&mdash;"The grievance?" he repeated, pausing as if to
consider&mdash;"Oh, that I forget."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It is impossible, of course, to
convey an idea of the dramatic humour with which he gave effect to
these<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>Pg 208</span> words; but his look and manner on such occasions were
irresistibly comic; and it was, indeed, rather in such turns of fun and
oddity, than in any more elaborate exhibition of wit, that the
pleasantry of his conversation consisted.</p>

<p>Though it is evident that, after the brilliant success of Childe Harold,
he had ceased to think of Parliament as an arena of ambition, yet, as a
field for observation, we may take for granted it was not unstudied by
him. To a mind of such quick and various views, every place and pursuit
presented some aspect of interest; and whether in the ball-room, the
boxing-school, or the senate, all must have been, by genius like his,
turned to profit. The following are a few of the recollections and
impressions which I find recorded by himself of his short parliamentary
career:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have never heard any one who fulfilled my ideal of an orator. Grattan
would have been near it, but for his harlequin delivery. Pitt I never
heard. Fox but once, and then he struck me as a debater, which to me
seems as different from an orator as an improvisatore, or a versifier,
from a poet. Grey is great, but it is not oratory. Canning is sometimes
very like one. Windham I did not admire, though all the world did; it
seemed sad sophistry. Whitbread was the Demosthenes of bad taste and
vulgar vehemence, but strong, and English. Holland is impressive from
sense and sincerity. Lord Lansdowne good, but still a debater only.
Grenville I like vastly, if he would prune his speeches down to an
hour's de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>Pg 209</span>livery. Burdett is sweet and silvery as Belial himself, and I
think the greatest favourite in Pandemonium; at least I always heard the
country gentlemen and the ministerial devilry praise his speeches <i>up</i>
stairs, and run down from Bellamy's when he was upon his legs. I heard
Bob Milnes make his <i>second</i> speech; it made no impression. I like
Ward&mdash;studied, but keen, and sometimes eloquent. Peel, my school and
form fellow (we sat within two of each other), strange to say, I have
never heard, though I often wished to do so; but from what I remember of
him at Harrow, he <i>is</i>, or <i>should</i> be, among the best of them. Now I do
<i>not</i> admire Mr. Wilberforce's speaking; it is nothing but a flow of
words&mdash;'words, words, alone.'</p>

<p>"I doubt greatly if the English have any eloquence, properly so called;
and am inclined to think that the Irish <i>had</i> a great deal, and that the
French <i>will</i> have, and have had in Mirabeau. Lord Chatham and Burke are
the nearest approaches to orators in England. I don't know what Erskine
may have been at the bar, but in the House I wish him at the bar once
more. Lauderdale is shrill, and Scotch, and acute.</p>

<p>"But amongst all these, good, bad, and indifferent, I never heard the
speech which was not too long for the auditors, and not very
intelligible, except here and there. The whole thing is a grand
deception, and as tedious and tiresome as may be to those who must be
often present. I heard Sheridan only once, and that briefly, but I liked
his voice, his manner, and his wit: and he is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>Pg 210</span> only one of them I
ever wished to hear at greater length.</p>

<p>"The impression of Parliament upon me was, that its members are not
formidable as <i>speakers</i>, but very much so as an <i>audience</i>; because in
so numerous a body there may be little eloquence, (after all, there were
but <i>two</i> thorough orators in all antiquity, and I suspect still <i>fewer</i>
in modern times,) but there must be a leaven of thought and good sense
sufficient to make them <i>know</i> what is right, though they can't express
it nobly.</p>

<p>"Horne Tooke and Roscoe both are said to have declared that they left
Parliament with a higher opinion of its aggregate integrity and
abilities than that with which they entered it. The general amount of
both in most Parliaments is probably about the same, as also the number
of <i>speakers</i> and their talent. I except <i>orators</i>, of course, because
they are things of ages, and not of septennial or triennial re-unions.
Neither House ever struck me with more awe or respect than the same
number of Turks in a divan, or of Methodists in a barn, would have done.
Whatever diffidence or nervousness I felt (and I felt both, in a great
degree) arose from the number rather than the quality of the assemblage,
and the thought rather of the <i>public without</i> than the persons
within,&mdash;knowing (as all know) that Cicero himself, and probably the
Messiah, could never have altered the vote of a single lord of the
bedchamber, or bishop. I thought <i>our</i> House dull, but the other
animating enough upon great days.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>Pg 211</span></p>

<p>"I have heard that when Grattan made his first speech in the English
Commons, it was for some minutes doubtful whether to laugh at or cheer
him. The <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i> of his predecessor, Flood, had been a complete failure,
under nearly similar circumstances. But when the ministerial part of our
senators had watched Pitt (their thermometer) for the cue, and saw him
nod repeatedly his stately nod of approbation, they took the hint from
their huntsman, and broke out into the most rapturous cheers. Grattan's
speech, indeed, deserved them; it was a <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>. I did not hear
<i>that</i> speech of his (being then at Harrow), but heard most of his
others on the same question&mdash;also that on the war of 1815. I differed
from his opinions on the latter question, but coincided in the general
admiration of his eloquence.</p>

<p>"When I met old Courtenay, the orator, at Rogers's, the poet's, in
1811-12, I was much taken with the portly remains of his fine figure,
and the still acute quickness of his conversation. It was <i>he</i> who
silenced Flood in the English House by a crushing reply to a hasty
<i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i> of the rival of Grattan in Ireland. I asked Courtenay (for I
like to trace motives) if he had not some personal provocation; for the
acrimony of his answer seemed to me, as I had read it, to involve it.
Courtenay said 'he had; that, when in Ireland (being an Irishman), at
the bar of the Irish House of Commons, Flood had made a personal and
unfair attack upon <i>himself</i>, who, not being a member of that House,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>Pg 212</span>
could not defend himself, and that some years afterwards the opportunity
of retort offering in the English Parliament, he could not resist it.'
He certainly repaid Flood with interest, for Flood never made any
figure, and only a speech or two afterwards, in the English House of
Commons. I must except, however, his speech on Reform in 1790, which Fox
called 'the best he ever heard upon that subject.'"</p>

<p>For some time he had entertained thoughts of going again abroad; and it
appeared, indeed, to be a sort of relief to him, whenever he felt
melancholy or harassed, to turn to the freedom and solitude of a life of
travel as his resource. During the depression of spirits which he
laboured under, while printing Childe Harold, "he would frequently,"
says Mr. Dallas, "talk of selling Newstead, and of going to reside at
Naxos, in the Grecian Archipelago,&mdash;to adopt the eastern costume and
customs, and to pass his time in studying the Oriental languages and
literature." The excitement of the triumph that soon after ensued, and
the success which, in other pursuits besides those of literature,
attended him, again diverted his thoughts from these migratory projects.
But the roving fit soon returned; and we have seen, from one of his
letters to Mr. William Bankes, that he looked forward to finding
himself, in the course of this spring, among the mountains of his
beloved Greece once more. For a time, this plan was exchanged for the
more social project of accompanying his friends, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>Pg 213</span> family of Lord
Oxford, to Sicily; and it was while engaged in his preparatives for this
expedition that the annexed letters were written.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 121. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Maidenhead, June 13. 1813.</p>

<p>"* * * I have read the 'Strictures,' which are just enough, and not
grossly abusive, in very fair couplets. There is a note against
Massinger near the end, and one cannot quarrel with one's company,
at any rate. The author detects some incongruous figures in a
passage of English Bards, page 23., but which edition I do not
know. In the <i>sole</i> copy in your possession&mdash;I mean the <i>fifth</i>
edition&mdash;you may make these alterations, that I may profit (though
a little too late) by his remarks:&mdash;For '<i>hellish</i> instinct,'
substitute '<i>brutal</i> instinct;' '<i>harpies</i>' alter to '<i>felons</i>;'
and for 'blood-hounds' write 'hell-hounds.'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> These be 'very

but as I shall not publish the thing, they can do no harm, but are
a satisfaction to me in the way of amendment. The passage is only
twelve lines.</p>

<p>"You do not answer me about H.'s book; I want to write to him, and
not to say any thing unpleasing. If you direct to Post Office,
Portsmouth, till <i>called</i> for, I will send and receive your letter.
You never told me of the forthcoming critique on Columbus, which is
not <i>too</i> fair; and I do not think justice quite done to the
'Pleasures,' which surely entitle the author to a higher rank than
that assigned him in the Quarterly. But I must not cavil at the
decisions of the <i>invisible infallibles</i>; and the article is very
well written. The general horror of '<i>fragments</i>' makes me
tremulous for 'The Giaour;' but you would publish it&mdash;I presume, by
this time, to your repentance. But as I consented, whatever be its
fate, I won't now quarrel with you, even though I detect it in my
pastry; but I shall not open a pie without apprehension for some
weeks.</p>

Clarke's Naufragia? I am told that he asserts the <i>first</i> volume of
Robinson Crusoe was written by the first Lord Oxford, when in the

<p>"I feel greatly at a loss how to write to you at all&mdash;still more to
thank you as I ought. If you knew the veneration with which I have
ever regarded you, long before I had the most distant prospect of
becoming your acquaintance, literary or personal, my embarrassment
would not surprise you.</p>

<p>"Any suggestion of yours, even were it conveyed in the less tender
shape of the text of the Baviad, or a Monk Mason note in Massinger,
would have been obeyed; I should have endeavoured to improve myself
by your censure: judge then if I should be less willing to profit
by your kindness. It is not for me to bandy compliments with my
elders and my betters: I receive your approbation with gratitude,
and will not return my brass for your gold by expressing more fully
those sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>Pg 216</span> of admiration, which, however sincere, would, I
know, be unwelcome.</p>

<p>"To your advice on religious topics, I shall equally attend.
Perhaps the best way will be by avoiding them altogether. The
already published objectionable passages have been much commented
upon, but certainly have been rather strongly interpreted. I am no
bigot to infidelity, and did not expect that, because I doubted the
immortality of man, I should be charged with denying the existence
of a God. It was the comparative insignificance of ourselves and
<i>our world</i>, when placed in comparison with the mighty whole, of
which it is an atom, that first led me to imagine that our
pretensions to eternity might be over-rated.</p>

<p>"This, and being early disgusted with a Calvinistic Scotch school,
where I was cudgelled to church for the first ten years of my life,
afflicted me with this malady; for, after all, it is, I believe, a
disease of the mind as much as other kinds of hypochondria."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"July 25. 1813.</p>

<p>"I am not well versed enough in the ways of single woman to make
much matrimonial progress.</p>

<p>"I have been dining like the dragon of Wantley for this last week.
My head aches with the vintage of various cellars, and my brains
are muddled as their dregs. I met your friends the D * * s:&mdash;she
sung one of your best songs so well, that, but for the appearance
of affectation, I could have cried; he reminds me of Hunt, but
handsomer, and more musical in soul, perhaps. I wish to God he may
conquer his horrible anomalous complaint. The upper part of her
face is beautiful, and she seems much attached to her husband. He
is right, nevertheless, in leaving this nauseous town. The first
winter would infallibly destroy her complexion,&mdash;and the second,
very probably, every thing else.</p>

<p>"I must tell you a story. M * * (of indifferent memory) was dining
out the other day, and complaining of the P&mdash;&mdash;e's coldness to his
old wassailers. D * * (a learned Jew) bored him with questions&mdash;why
this? and why that? 'Why did the P&mdash;&mdash;e act thus?'&mdash;'Why, sir, on
account of Lord * *, who ought to be ashamed of himself.'&mdash;'And why
ought Lord * * to be ashamed of himself?'&mdash;'Because the P&mdash;&mdash;e,
sir, * * * * * * * *.'&mdash;'And why, sir, did the P&mdash;&mdash;e cut
<i>you</i>?'&mdash;' Because, G&mdash;&mdash;d d&mdash;&mdash;mme, sir, I stuck to my
principles.'&mdash;'And <i>why</i> did you stick to your principles?'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>Pg 222</span></p>

<p>"Is not this last question the best that was ever put, when you
consider to whom? It nearly killed M * *. Perhaps you may think it
stupid, but, as Goldsmith said about the peas, it was a very good
joke when I heard it&mdash;as I did from an ear-witness&mdash;and is only
spoilt in my narration.</p>

<p>"The season has closed with a dandy ball;&mdash;but I have dinners with
the Harrowbys, Rogers, and Frere and Mackintosh, where I shall
drink your health in a silent bumper, and regret your absence till
'too much canaries' wash away my memory, or render it superfluous
by a vision of you at the opposite side of the table. Canning has
disbanded his party by a speech from his * * * *&mdash;the true throne
of a Tory. Conceive his turning them off in a formal harangue, and
bidding them think for themselves. 'I have led my ragamuffins where
they are well peppered. There are but three of the 150 left alive,
and they are for the <i>Towns-end</i> (<i>query</i>, might not Falstaff mean
the Bow Street officer? I dare say Malone's posthumous edition will
have it so) for life.'</p>

<p>"Since I wrote last, I have been into the country. I journeyed by
night&mdash;no incident, or accident, but an alarm on the part of my
valet on the outside, who, in crossing Epping Forest, actually, I
believe, flung down his purse before a mile-stone, with a glow-worm
in the second figure of number XIX&mdash;mistaking it for a footpad and
dark lantern. I can only attribute his fears to a pair of new
pistols wherewith I had armed him; and he thought it necessary to
display his vigilance by calling out to me when<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>Pg 223</span>ever we passed any
thing&mdash;no matter whether moving or stationary. Conceive ten miles,
with a tremor every furlong. I have scribbled you a fearfully long
letter. This sheet must be blank, and is merely a wrapper, to
preclude the tabellarians of the post from peeping. You once
complained of my <i>not</i> writing;&mdash;I will 'heap coals of fire upon

it entirely to your sylvan sequestration at Mayfield Cottage. You

This is the second letter you have enclosed to my address,
notwithstanding a miraculous long answer, and a subsequent short

undue advantage over a too susceptible senator, by forwarding your
lucubrations to every one but himself. I won't frank <i>from</i> you, or

<p>So early as the autumn of this year, a fifth edition of The Giaour was
required; and again his fancy teemed with fresh materials for its pages.
The verses commencing "The browsing camels' bells are tinkling," and the
four pages that follow the line, "Yes, love indeed is light from
heaven," were all added at this time. Nor had the overflowings of his
mind even yet ceased, as I find in the poem, as it exists at present,
still further additions,&mdash;and, among them, those four brilliant lines,&mdash;</p>

your eye from discovering some <i>o</i>mission of mine or <i>com</i>mission

been lengthening its rattles every month. It is now fearfully long,
being more than a Canto and a half of Childe Harold, which contains
but 882 lines per book, with all late additions inclusive.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 133. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bennet Street, August 22. 1813.</p>

<p>"As our late&mdash;I might say, deceased&mdash;correspondence had too much of
the town-life leaven in it, we will now, 'paulo majora,' prattle a
little of literature in all its branches; and first of the
first&mdash;criticism. The Prince is at Brighton, and Jackson, the
boxer, gone to Margate, having, I believe, decoyed Yarmouth to see
a milling in that polite neighbourhood. Made. de Sta&euml;l Holstein has
lost one of her young barons, who has been carbonadoed by a vile
Teutonic adjutant,&mdash;kilt and killed in a coffee-house at
Scrawsenhawsen. Corinne is, of course, what all mothers must
be,&mdash;but will, I venture to prophesy, do what few mothers
could&mdash;write an Essay upon it. She cannot exist without a
grievance&mdash;and somebody to see, or read, how much grief becomes
her. I have not seen her since the event; but merely judge (not
very charitably) from prior observation.</p>

<p>"In a 'mail-coach copy' of the Edinburgh, I perceive The Giaour is
second article. The numbers are still in the Leith smack&mdash;<i>pray,
which way is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>Pg 231</span> the wind?</i> The said article is so very mild and
sentimental, that it must be written by Jeffrey <i>in love</i>;&mdash;you
know he is gone to America to marry some fair one, of whom he has
been, for several <i>quarters, &eacute;perdument amoureux</i>. Seriously&mdash;as
Winifred Jenkins says of Lismahago&mdash;Mr. Jeffrey (or his deputy)
'has done the handsome thing by me,' and I say <i>nothing</i>. But this
I will say, if you and I had knocked one another on the head in
this quarrel, how he would have laughed, and what a mighty bad
figure we should have cut in our posthumous works. By the by, I was
called <i>in</i> the other day to mediate between two gentlemen bent
upon carnage, and,&mdash;after a long struggle between the natural
desire of destroying one's fellow-creatures, and the dislike of
seeing men play the fool for nothing,&mdash;I got one to make an
apology, and the other to take it, and left them to live happy ever
after. One was a peer, the other a friend untitled, and both fond
of high play;&mdash;and one, I can swear for, though very mild, 'not
fearful,' and so dead a shot, that, though the other is the
thinnest of men, he would have split him like a cane. They both
conducted themselves very well, and I put them out of <i>pain</i> as
soon as I could.</p>

<p>"There is an American Life of G.F. Cooke, <i>Scurra</i> deceased, lately
published. Such a book!&mdash;I believe, since Drunken Barnaby's
Journal, nothing like it has drenched the press. All green-room and
tap-room&mdash;drams and the drama&mdash;brandy, whisky-punch, and,
<i>latterly</i>, toddy, overflow every page. Two things are rather
marvellous,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>Pg 232</span>first, that a man should live so long drunk, and,

all probability, be as foolishly spent on shore as in the ship; but
one like's to have one's choice, nevertheless. Town is awfully
empty; but not the worse for that. I am really puzzled with my

it, but where to go?<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Sligo is for the North;&mdash;a pleasant place,

brilliant sex; but the fact is, I am at this moment in a far more
serious, and entirely new, scrape than any of the last twelve
months,&mdash;and that is saying a good deal. It is unlucky we can
neither live with nor without these women.</p>

<p>"I am now thinking of regretting that, just as I have left
Newstead, you reside near it. Did you ever see it? <i>do</i>&mdash;but don't
tell me that you like it. If I had known of such intellectual
neighbourhood, I don't think I should have quitted it. You could
have come over so often, as a bachelor,&mdash;for it was a thorough
bachelor's mansion&mdash;plenty of wine and such sordid
sensualities&mdash;with books enough, room enough, and an air of
antiquity about all (except the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>Pg 234</span> lasses) that would have suited
you, when pensive, and served you to laugh at when in glee. I had
built myself a bath and a <i>vault</i>&mdash;and now I sha'n't even be buried
in it. It is odd that we can't even be certain of a <i>grave</i>, at
least a particular one. I remember, when about fifteen, reading
your poems there, which I can repeat almost now,&mdash;and asking all
kinds of questions about the author, when I heard that he was not
dead according to the preface; wondering if I should ever see
him&mdash;and though, at that time, without the smallest poetical
propensity myself, very much taken, as you may imagine, with that
volume. Adieu&mdash;I commit you to the care of the gods&mdash;Hindoo,
Scandinavian, and Hellenic!</p>

<p>"P.S. 2d. There is an excellent review of Grimm's Correspondence
and Made. de Sta&euml;l in this No. of the E.R. Jeffrey, himself, was my
critic last year; but this is, I believe, by another hand. I hope
you are going on with your <i>grand coup</i>&mdash;pray do&mdash;or that damned
Lucien Buonaparte will beat us all. I have seen much of his poem in
MS., and he really surpasses every thing beneath Tasso. Hodgson is
translating him <i>against</i> another bard. You and (I believe,
Rogers,) Scott, Gifford, and myself, are to be referred to as
judges between the twain,&mdash;that is, if you accept the office.
Conceive our different opinions! I think we, most of us (I am

but still giving us a right to expect a <i>Shah Nameh</i> (is that the
name?) as well as gazels. Stick to the East;&mdash;the oracle, Sta&euml;l,
told me it was the only poetical policy. The North, South, and
West, have all been exhausted; but from the East, we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>Pg 237</span> nothing
but S * *'s unsaleables,&mdash;and these he has contrived to spoil, by
adopting only their most outrageous fictions. His personages don't
interest us, and yours will. You will have no competitor; and, if
you had, you ought to be glad of it. The little I have done in that
way is merely a 'voice in the wilderness' for you; and if it has
had any success, that also will prove that the public are
orientalising, and pave the path for you.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of a story, grafted on the amours of a Peri
and a mortal&mdash;something like, only more <i>philanthropical</i> than,
Cazotte's Diable Amoureux. It would require a good deal of poesy,
and tenderness is not my forte. For that, and other reasons, I have
given up the idea, and merely suggest it to you, because, in

<p><b>LETTER 135. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"August&mdash;September, I mean&mdash;1. 1813.</p>

<p>"I send you, begging your acceptance, Castellan, and three vols. on
Turkish Literature, not yet looked into. The <i>last</i> I will thank
you to read, extract what you want, and return in a week, as they
are lent to me by that brightest of Northern constellations,
Mackintosh,&mdash;amongst many other kind things into which India has
warmed him, for I am sure your <i>home</i> Scotsman is of a less genial
description.</p>

<p>"Your Peri, my dear M., is sacred and inviolable; I have no idea of
touching the hem of her petticoat. Your affectation of a dislike to
encounter me is so flattering, that I begin to think myself a very
fine fellow. But you are laughing at me&mdash;'Stap my vitals, Tarn!
thou art a very impudent person;' and, if you are not laughing at
me, you deserve to be laughed at. Seriously, what on earth can you,
or have you, to dread from any poetical flesh breathing? It really
puts me out of humour to hear you talk thus.</p>

<p>"'The Giaour' I have added to a good deal; but still in foolish
fragments. It contains about 1200 lines, or rather more&mdash;now
printing. You will allow me to send you a copy. You delight me<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>Pg 239</span>
much by telling me that I am in your good graces, and more
particularly as to temper; for, unluckily, I have the reputation of
a very bad one. But they say the devil is amusing when pleased, and
I must have been more venomous than the old serpent, to have hissed
or stung in your company. It may be, and would appear to a third
person, an incredible thing, but I know you will believe me when I
say, that I am as anxious for your success as one human being can
be for another's,&mdash;as much as if I had never scribbled a line.
Surely the field of fame is wide enough for all; and if it were
not, I would not willingly rob my neighbour of a rood of it. Now
you have a pretty property of some thousand acres there, and when
you have passed your present Inclosure Bill, your income will be
doubled, (there's a metaphor, worthy of a Templar, namely, pert and
low,) while my wild common is too remote to incommode you, and
quite incapable of such fertility. I send you (which return per
post, as the printer would say) a curious letter from a friend of
mine<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, which will let you into the origin of 'The Giaour.' Write
soon. Ever, dear Moore, yours most entirely, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;This letter was written to me on account of a <i>different
story</i> circulated by some gentlewomen of our acquaintance, a little
too close to the text. The part erased contained merely some
Turkish names, and circumstantial evidence of the girl's detection,
not very important or decorous."</p></div>

<p>"You need not tie yourself down to a day with Toderini, but send
him at your leisure, having anatomised him into such annotations as
you want; I do not believe that he has ever undergone that process
before, which is the best reason for not sparing him now.</p>

<p>"* * has returned to town, but not yet recovered of the Quarterly.
What fellows these reviewers are! 'these bugs do fear us all.' They
made you fight, and me (the milkiest of men) a satirist, and will
end by making * * madder than Ajax. I have been reading Memory
again, the other day, and Hope together, and retain all my
preference of the former. His elegance is really wonderful&mdash;there
is no such thing as a vulgar line in his book.</p>

<p>"What say you to Buonaparte? Remember, I back him against the
field, barring Catalepsy and the Elements. Nay, I almost wish him
success against all countries but this,&mdash;were it only to choke the
Morning Post, and his undutiful father-in-law, with that rebellious
bastard of Scandinavian adoption, Bernadotte. Rogers wants me to go
with him on a crusade to the Lakes, and to besiege you on our way.
This last is a great temptation, but I fear it will not be in my
power, unless you would go on with one of us somewhere&mdash;no matter
where. It is too late for Matlock, but we might hit upon some
scheme, high life or low,&mdash;the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>Pg 241</span> would be much the best for
amusement. I am so sick of the other, that I quite sigh for a
cider-cellar, or a cruise in a smuggler's sloop.</p>

<p>"You cannot wish more than I do that the Fates were a little more
accommodating to our parallel lines, which prolong ad infinitum
without coming a jot nearer. I almost wish I were married,
too&mdash;which is saying much. All my friends, seniors and juniors, are
in for it, and ask me to be godfather,&mdash;the only species of
parentage which, I believe, will ever come to my share in a lawful
way; and, in an unlawful one, by the blessing of Lucina, we can
never be certain,&mdash;though the parish may. I suppose I shall hear
from you to-morrow. If not, this goes as it is; but I leave room
for a P.S., in case any thing requires an answer. Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"No letter&mdash;<i>n'importe</i>. R. thinks the Quarterly will be at <i>me</i>
this time: if so, it shall be a war of extermination&mdash;no <i>quarter</i>.
From the youngest devil down to the oldest woman of that review,
all shall perish by one fatal lampoon. The ties of nature shall be
torn asunder, for I will not even spare my bookseller; nay, if one

of his spoils. By this coach I send you a copy of that awful

compliment as your modest alarm. You will (if inclined in an
evening) perceive that I have added much in quantity,&mdash;a
circumstance which may truly diminish your modesty upon the
subject.</p>

<p>"You stand certainly in great need of a 'lift' with Mackintosh. My
dear Moore, you strangely under-rate yourself. I should conceive it
an affectation in any other; but I think I know you well enough to
believe that you don't know your own value. However, 'tis a fault
that generally mends; and, in your case, it really ought. I have
heard him speak of you as highly as your wife could wish; and
enough to give all your friends the jaundice.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I had a letter from <i>Ali Pacha!</i> brought by Dr. Holland,
who is just returned from Albania. It is in Latin, and begins
'Excellentissime <i>nec non</i> Carissime,' and ends about a gun he
wants made for him;&mdash;it is signed 'Ali Vizir.' What do you think he
has been about? H. tells me that, last spring, he took a hostile
town, where, forty-two years ago, his mother and sisters were
treated as Miss Cunigunde was by the Bulgarian cavalry. He takes
the town, selects all the survivors of this exploit&mdash;children,
grandchildren, &amp;c. to the tune of six hundred, and has them shot
before his face. Recollect, he spared the rest of the city, and
confined himself to the Tarquin pedigree,&mdash;which is more than I
would. So much for 'dearest friend.'"</p></div>

elsewhere, and take what, in <i>flash</i> dialect, is poetically termed
'a lark,' with Rogers and me for accomplices. Yesterday, at Holland
House, I was introduced to Southey&mdash;the best looking bard I have
seen for some time. To have that poet's head and shoulders, I would
almost have written his Sapphics. He is certainly a prepossess<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>Pg 244</span>ing

with due respect, and which, inheriting the family taste, I looked
upon with great satisfaction. I stayed a week with the family, and
behaved very well&mdash;though the lady of the house is young, and
religious, and pretty, and the master is my particular friend. I
felt no wish for any thing but a poodle dog, which they kindly gave
me. Now, for a man of my courses not even to have <i>coveted</i>, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>Pg 245</span> a

<p>"You have not answered some six letters of mine. This, therefore,
is my penultimate. I will write to you once more, but, after
that&mdash;I swear by all the saints&mdash;I am silent and supercilious. I
have met Curran at Holland House&mdash;he beats every body;&mdash;his
imagination is beyond human, and his humour (it is difficult to
define what is wit) perfect. Then he has fifty faces, and twice as
many voices, when he mimics&mdash;I never met his equal. Now, were I a
woman, and eke a virgin, that is the man I should make my
Scamander. He is quite fascinating. Remember, I have met him but
once; and you, who have known him long, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>Pg 246</span> probably deduct from
my panegyric. I almost fear to meet him again, lest the impression
should be lowered. He talked a great deal about you&mdash;a theme never
tiresome to me, nor any body else that I know. What a variety of
expression he conjures into that naturally not very fine
countenance of his! He absolutely changes it entirely. I have
done&mdash;for I can't describe him, and you know him. On Sunday I
return to * *, where I shall not be far from you. Perhaps I shall
hear from you in the mean time. Good night.</p>

<p>"Saturday morn&mdash;Your letter has cancelled all my anxieties. I did
<i>not suspect</i> you in <i>earnest</i>. Modest again! Because I don't do a
very shabby thing, it seems, I 'don't fear your competition.' If it
were reduced to an alternative of preference, I <i>should</i> dread you,
as much as Satan does Michael. But is there not room enough in our
respective regions? Go on&mdash;it will soon be my turn to forgive.
To-day I dine with Mackintosh and Mrs. <i>Stale</i>&mdash;as John Bull may be

indifferent,&mdash;not to make me forget you, but to prevent me from
reminding you of one who, nevertheless, has often thought of you,
and to whom <i>your</i> thoughts, in many a measure, have frequently
been a consolation. We were once very near neighbours this autumn;
and a good and bad neighbourhood it has proved to me. Suffice it to
say, that your French quotation was confoundedly to the

of losing the little I have gained in fame, by this further
experiment on public patience; but I have really ceased to care on
that head. I have written this, and published it, for the sake of
the <i>employment</i>,&mdash;to wring my thoughts from reality, and take
refuge in 'imaginings,' however 'horrible;' and, as to success!
those who succeed will console me for a failure&mdash;excepting yourself

<div class="blockquot"><p>"December 8. 1813.</p>

<p>"Your letter, like all the best, and even kindest things in this
world, is both painful and pleasing. But, first, to what sits
nearest. Do you know I was actually about to dedicate to you,&mdash;not
in a formal inscription, as to one's <i>elders</i>,&mdash;but through a
short<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>Pg 249</span> prefatory letter, in which I boasted myself your intimate,
and held forth the prospect of <i>your</i> poem; when, lo! the
recollection of your strict injunctions of secrecy as to the said
poem, more than <i>once</i> repeated by word and letter, flashed upon
me, and marred my intents. I could have no motive for repressing my
own desire of alluding to you (and not a day passes that I do not
think and talk of you), but an idea that you might, yourself,
dislike it. You cannot doubt my sincere admiration, waving personal
friendship for the present, which, by the by, is not less sincere
and deep rooted. I have you by rote and by heart; of which 'ecce
signum!' When I was at * *, on my first visit, I have a habit, in
passing my time a good deal alone, of&mdash;I won't call it singing, for
that I never attempt except to myself&mdash;but of uttering, to what I
think tunes, your 'Oh breathe not,' 'When the last glimpse,' and
'When he who adores thee,' with others of the same minstrel;&mdash;they
are my matins and vespers. I assuredly did not intend them to be
overheard, but, one morning, in comes, not La Donna, but Il Marito,
with a very grave face, saying, 'Byron, I must request you won't
sing any more, at least of <i>those</i> songs.' I stared, and said,
'Certainly, but why?'&mdash;'To tell you the truth,' quoth he, 'they
make my wife <i>cry</i>, and so melancholy, that I wish her to hear no
more of them.'</p>

<p>"Now, my dear M., the effect must have been from your words, and
certainly not my music. I merely mention this foolish story to show
you how much I am indebted to you for even your pas<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>Pg 250</span>times. A man
may praise and praise, but no one recollects but that which
pleases&mdash;at least, in composition. Though I think no one equal to
you in that department, or in satire,&mdash;and surely no one was ever
so popular in both,&mdash;I certainly am of opinion that you have not
yet done all <i>you</i> can do, though more than enough for any one
else. I want, and the world expects, a longer work from you; and I
see in you what I never saw in poet before, a strange diffidence of
your own powers, which I cannot account for, and which must be
unaccountable, when a <i>Cossac</i> like me can appal a <i>cuirassier</i>.
Your story I did not, could not, know,&mdash;I thought only of a Peri. I
wish you had confided in me, not for your sake, but mine, and to
prevent the world from losing a much better poem than my own, but
which, I yet hope, this <i>clashing</i> will not even now deprive them
of.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Mine is the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>Pg 251</span> of a week, written, <i>why</i> I have partly
told you, and partly I cannot tell you by letter&mdash;some day I will.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;I shall really be very unhappy if I at all interfere with
you. The success of mine is yet problematical; though the public
will probably purchase a certain quantity, on the presumption of
their own propensity for 'The Giaour' and such 'horrid mysteries.'
The only advantage I have is being on the spot; and that merely
amounts to saving me the trouble of turning over books which I had
better read again. If <i>your chamber</i> was furnished in the same way,
you have no need to <i>go there</i> to describe&mdash;I mean only as to
<i>accuracy</i>&mdash;because I drew it from recollection.</p>

<p>"This last thing of mine <i>may</i> have the same fate, and I assure you
I have great doubts about it. But, even if not, its little day will
be over before you are ready and willing. Come out&mdash;'screw your
courage to the sticking-place.' Except the Post Bag (and surely you
cannot complain of a want of success there), you have not been
<i>regularly</i> out for some years. No man stands higher,&mdash;whatever you
may think on a rainy day, in your provincial retreat. 'Aucun homme,
dans aucune langue, n'a &eacute;t&eacute;, peut-&ecirc;tre, plus complet&egrave;ment le po&euml;te

&ecirc;tre; <i>mais les femmes r&eacute;pondent qu'il l'a repr&eacute;sent&eacute; tel qu'elles
le d&eacute;sirent</i>.'&mdash;I should have thought Sismondi had written this for
you instead of Metastasio.</p>

<p>"Write to me, and tell me of <i>yourself</i>. Do you remember what
Rousseau said to some one&mdash;'Have we quarrelled? you have talked to
me often, and never once mentioned yourself.'</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;The last sentence is an indirect apology for my own
egotism,&mdash;but I believe in letters it is allowed. I wish it was
<i>mutual</i>. I have met with an odd reflection in Grimm; it shall
not&mdash;at least the bad part&mdash;be applied to you or me, though <i>one</i>
of us has certainly an indifferent name&mdash;but this it is:&mdash;'Many
people have the reputation of being wicked, with whom we should be
too happy to pass our lives.' I need not add it is a woman's
saying&mdash;a Mademoiselle de Sommery's."</p></div>

<p>At this time Lord Byron commenced a Journal, or Diary, from the pages of
which I have already selected a few extracts, and of which I shall now
lay as much more as is producible before the reader. Employed
chiefly,&mdash;as such a record, from its nature, must be,&mdash;about persons
still living, and occurrences still recent, it would be impossible, of
course, to submit it to the public eye, without the omission of some
portion of its contents, and unluckily, too, of that very portion which,
from its reference to the secret pursuits and feelings of the writer,
would the most livelily pique and gratify the curiosity of the reader.
Enough, however, will, I trust, still remain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>Pg 253</span> even after all this
necessary winnowing, to enlarge still further the view we have here
opened into the interior of the poet's life and habits, and to indulge
harmlessly that taste, as general as it is natural, which leads us to
contemplate with pleasure a great mind in its undress, and to rejoice in
the discovery, so consoling to human pride, that even the mightiest, in

<p>"If this had been begun ten years ago, and faithfully kept!!!&mdash;heigho!
there are too many things I wish never to have remembered, as it is.
Well,&mdash;have had my share of what are called the pleasures of this life,
and have seen more of the European and Asiatic world than I have made a
good use of. They say 'Virtue is its own reward,'&mdash;it certainly should
be paid well for its trouble. At five-and-twenty, when the better part
of life is over, one should be <i>something</i>;&mdash;and what am I? nothing but
five-and-twenty&mdash;and the odd months. What have I seen? the same man all
over the world,&mdash;ay, and woman too. Give <i>me</i> a Mussulman who never asks
questions, and a she of the same race who saves one the trouble of
putting them. But for this same plague&mdash;yellow fever&mdash;and Newstead
delay, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>Pg 254</span> should have been by this time a second time close to the
Euxine. If I can overcome the last, I don't so much mind your
pestilence; and, at any rate, the spring shall see me there,&mdash;provided I
neither marry myself, nor unmarry any one else in the interval. I wish
one was&mdash;I don't know what I wish. It is odd I never set myself
seriously to wishing without attaining it&mdash;and repenting. I begin to
believe with the good old Magi, that one should only pray for the
nation, and not for the individual;&mdash;but, on my principle, this would
not be very patriotic.</p>

<p>"No more reflections&mdash;Let me see&mdash;last night I finished 'Zuleika,' my
second Turkish Tale. I believe the composition of it kept me alive&mdash;for
it was written to drive my thoughts from the recollection of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dear sacred name, rest ever unreveal'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At least, even here, my hand would tremble to write it. This afternoon I
have burnt the scenes of my commenced comedy. I have some idea of
expectorating a romance, or rather a tale in prose;&mdash;but what romance
could equal the events&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'qu&aelig;que ipse ...vidi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et quorum pars magna fui.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To-day Henry Byron called on me with my little cousin Eliza. She will
grow up a beauty and a plague; but, in the mean time, it is the
prettiest child! dark eyes and eyelashes, black and long as the wing of
a raven. I think she is prettier even<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>Pg 255</span> than my niece, Georgina,&mdash;yet I
don't like to think so neither; and though older, she is not so clever.</p>

<p>"Dallas called before I was up, so we did not meet. Lewis, too,&mdash;who
seems out of humour with every thing. What can be the matter? he is not
married&mdash;has he lost his own mistress, or any other person's wife?
Hodgson, too, came. He is going to be married, and he is the kind of man
who will be the happier. He has talent, cheerfulness, every thing that
can make him a pleasing companion; and his intended is handsome and
young, and all that. But I never see any one much improved by matrimony.
All my coupled contemporaries are bald and discontented. W. and S. have
both lost their hair and good humour; and the last of the two had a good
deal to lose. But it don't much signify what falls <i>off</i> a man's temples
in that state.</p>

<p>"Mem. I must get a toy to-morrow, for Eliza, and send the device for the
seals of myself and * * * * * Mem. too, to call on the Sta&euml;l and Lady
Holland to-morrow, and on * *, who has advised me (without seeing it, by
the by) not to publish 'Zuleika;' I believe he is right, but experience
might have taught him that not to print is <i>physically</i> impossible. No
one has seen it but Hodgson and Mr. Gifford. I never in my life <i>read</i> a
composition, save to Hodgson, as he pays me in kind. It is a horrible
thing to do too frequently;&mdash;better print, and they who like may read,
and if they don't like, you have the satisfaction of knowing that they
have, at least, <i>purchased</i> the right of saying so.</p>

<p>"I have declined presenting the Debtors' Petition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>Pg 256</span> being sick of
parliamentary mummeries. I have spoken thrice; but I doubt my ever
becoming an orator. My first was liked; the second and third&mdash;I don't
know whether they succeeded or not. I have never yet set to it <i>con
amore</i>;&mdash;one must have some excuse to one's self for laziness, or
inability, or both, and this is mine. 'Company, villanous company, hath
been the spoil of me;'&mdash;and then, I have 'drunk medicines,' not to make
me love others, but certainly enough to hate myself.</p>

<p>"Two nights ago I saw the tigers sup at Exeter 'Change. Except Veli
Pacha's lion in the Morea,&mdash;who followed the Arab keeper like a
dog,&mdash;the fondness of the hy&aelig;na for her keeper amused me most. Such a
conversazione!&mdash;There was a 'hippopotamus,' like Lord L&mdash;&mdash;l in the
face; and the 'Ursine Sloth' hath the very voice and manner of my
valet&mdash;but the tiger talked too much. The elephant took and gave me my
money again&mdash;took off my hat&mdash;opened a door&mdash;<i>trunked</i> a whip&mdash;and
behaved so well, that I wish he was my butler. The handsomest animal on
earth is one of the panthers; but the poor antelopes were dead. I should
hate to see one <i>here</i>:&mdash;the sight of the <i>camel</i> made me pine again for
Asia Minor. 'Oh quando te aspiciam?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"November 16.</p>

<p>"Went last night with Lewis to see the first of Antony and Cleopatra. It
was admirably got up, and well acted&mdash;a salad of Shakspeare and Dryden,
Cleopatra strikes me as the epitome of her sex&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>Pg 257</span>fond, lively, sad,
tender, teasing, humble, haughty, beautiful, the devil!&mdash;coquettish to
the last, as well with the 'asp' as with Antony. After doing all she can
to persuade him that&mdash;but why do they abuse him for cutting off that
poltroon Cicero's head? Did not Tully tell Brutus it was a pity to have
spared Antony? and did he not speak the Philippics? and are not '<i>words
things</i>?' and such '<i>words</i>' very pestilent '<i>things</i>' too? If he had
had a hundred heads, they deserved (from Antony) a rostrum (his was
stuck up there) apiece&mdash;though, after all, he might as well have
pardoned him, for the credit of the thing. But to resume&mdash;Cleopatra,
after securing him, says, 'yet go&mdash;it is your interest,' &amp;c.&mdash;how like
the sex! and the questions about Octavia&mdash;it is woman all over.</p>

<p>"To-day received Lord Jersey's invitation to Middleton&mdash;to travel sixty
miles to meet Madame * *! I once travelled three thousand to get among
silent people; and this same lady writes octavos, and <i>talks</i> folios. I
have read her books&mdash;like most of them, and delight in the last; so I
won't hear it, as well as read.</p>

<p>"Read Burns to-day. What would he have been, if a patrician? We should
have had more polish&mdash;less force&mdash;just as much verse, but no
immortality&mdash;a divorce and a duel or two, the which had he survived, as
his potations must have been less spirituous, he might have lived as
long as Sheridan, and outlived as much as poor Brinsley. What a wreck is
that man! and all from bad pilotage; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>Pg 258</span> no one had ever better gales,
though now and then a little too squally. Poor dear Sherry! I shall
never forget the day he and Rogers and Moore and I passed together; when
<i>he</i> talked, and <i>we</i> listened, without one yawn, from six till one in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Got my seals * * * * * * Have again forgot a plaything for <i>ma petite
cousine</i> Eliza; but I must send for it to-morrow. I hope Harry will
bring her to me. I sent Lord Holland the proofs of the last 'Giaour,'
and 'The Bride of Abydos.' He won't like the latter, and I don't think
that I shall long. It was written in four nights to distract my dreams
from * *. Were it not thus, it had never been composed; and had I not
done something at that time, I must have gone mad, by eating my own
heart,&mdash;bitter diet!&mdash;Hodgson likes it better than 'The Giaour,' but
nobody else will,&mdash;and he never liked the Fragment. I am sure, had it
not been for Murray, <i>that</i> would never have been published, though the
circumstances which are the groundwork make it * * * heigh-ho!</p>

<p>"To-night I saw both the sisters of * *; my God! the youngest so like! I
thought I should have sprung across the house, and am so glad no one was
with me in Lady H.'s box. I hate those likenesses&mdash;the mock-bird, but
not the nightingale&mdash;so like as to remind, so different as to be
painful.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> One quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>Pg 259</span> equally with the points of resemblance and of
distinction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nov. 17.</p>

<p>"No letter from * *; but I must not complain. The respectable Job says,
'Why should a <i>living man</i> complain?' I really don't know, except it be
that a <i>dead man</i> can't; and he, the said patriarch, <i>did</i> complain,
nevertheless, till his friends were tired and his wife recommended that
pious prologue, 'Curse&mdash;and die;' the only time, I suppose, when but
little relief is to be found in swearing. I have had a most kind letter
from Lord Holland on 'The Bride of Abydos,' which he likes, and so does
Lady H. This is very good-natured in both, from whom I don't deserve any
quarter. Yet I <i>did</i> think, at the time, that my cause of enmity
proceeded from Holland House, and am glad I was wrong, and wish I had
not been in such a hurry with that confounded satire, of which I would
suppress even the memory;&mdash;but people, now they can't get it, make a
fuss, I verily believe, out of contradiction.</p>

<p>"George Ellis and Murray have been talking something about Scott and me,
George pro Scoto,&mdash;and very right too. If they want to depose him, I
only wish they would not set me up as a competitor. Even if I had my
choice, I would rather be the Earl of Warwick than all the <i>kings</i> he
ever made! Jeffrey and Gifford I take to be the monarch-makers in poetry
and prose. The British Critic, in their Rokeby Review, have presupposed
a comparison, which I am sure my friends never<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>Pg 260</span> thought of, and W.
Scott's subjects are injudicious in descending to. I like the man&mdash;and
admire his works to what Mr. Braham calls <i>Entusymusy</i>. All such stuff
can only vex him, and do me no good. Many hate his politics&mdash;(I hate all
politics); and, here, a man's politics are like the Greek <i>soul</i>&mdash;an
&#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957;, besides God knows what <i>other soul</i>; but their
estimate of the two generally go together.</p>

<p>"Harry has not brought <i>ma petite cousine</i>. I want us to go to the play
together;&mdash;she has been but once. Another short note from Jersey,
inviting Rogers and me on the 23d. I must see my agent to-night. I
wonder when that Newstead business will be finished. It cost me more
than words to part with it&mdash;and to <i>have</i> parted with it! What matters
it what I do? or what becomes of me?&mdash;but let me remember Job's saying,
and console myself with being 'a living man.'</p>

<p>"I wish I could settle to reading again,&mdash;my life is monotonous, and yet
desultory. I take up books, and fling them down again. I began a comedy,
and burnt it because the scene ran into <i>reality</i>;&mdash;a novel, for the
same reason. In rhyme, I can keep more away from facts; but the thought
always runs through, through ... yes, yes, through. I have had a letter
from Lady Melbourne&mdash;the best friend I ever had in my life, and the
cleverest of women.</p>

<p>"Not a word from * *. Have they set out from * *? or has my last
precious epistle fallen into the lion's jaws? If so&mdash;and this silence
looks suspicious, I must clap on my 'musty morion' and 'hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>Pg 261</span> out my
iron.' I am out of practice&mdash;but I won't begin again at Manton's now.
Besides, I would not return his shot. I was once a famous
wafer-splitter; but then the bullies of society made it necessary. Ever
since I began to feel that I had a bad cause to support, I have left off
the exercise.</p>

<p>"What strange tidings from that Anakim of anarchy&mdash;Buonaparte! Ever
since I defended my bust of him at Harrow against the rascally
time-servers, when the war broke out in 1803, he has been a 'H&eacute;ros de
Roman' of mine&mdash;on the Continent; I don't want him here. But I don't
like those same flights&mdash;leaving of armies, &amp;c. &amp;c. I am sure when I
fought for his bust at school, I did not think he would run away from
himself. But I should not wonder if he banged them yet. To be beat by
men would be something; but by three stupid, legitimate-old-dynasty
boobies of regular-bred sovereigns&mdash;O-hone-a-rie!&mdash;O-hone-a-rie! It must
be, as Cobbett says, his marriage with the thick-lipped and thick-headed
<i>Autrichienne</i> brood. He had better have kept to her who was kept by
Barras. I never knew any good come of your young wife, and legal
espousals, to any but your 'sober-blooded boy' who 'eats fish' and
drinketh 'no sack.' Had he not the whole opera? all Paris? all France?
But a mistress is just as perplexing&mdash;that is, <i>one</i>&mdash;two or more are
manageable by division.</p>

<p>"I have begun, or had begun, a song, and flung it into the fire. It was
in remembrance of Mary Duff, my first of flames, before most people
begin to burn. I wonder what the devil is the matter with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>Pg 262</span> me! I can do
nothing, and&mdash;fortunately there is nothing to do. It has lately been in
my power to make two persons (and their connections) comfortable, <i>pro
tempore</i>, and one happy, <i>ex tempore</i>,&mdash;I rejoice in the last
particularly, as it is an excellent man<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. I wish there had been more
inconvenience and less gratification to my self-love in it, for then
there had been more merit. We are all selfish&mdash;and I believe, ye gods of
Epicurus! I believe in Rochefoucault about <i>men</i>, and in Lucretius (not
Busby's translation) about yourselves. Your bard has made you very
<i>nonchalant</i> and blest; but as he has excused <i>us</i> from damnation, I
don't envy you your blessedness <i>much</i>&mdash;a little, to be sure. I
remember, last year, * * said to me, at * *, 'Have we not passed our
last month like the gods of Lucretius?' And so we had. She is an adept
in the text of the original (which I like too); and when that booby Bus.
sent his translating prospectus, she subscribed. But, the devil
prompting him to add a specimen, she transmitted him a subsequent
answer, saying, that 'after perusing it, her conscience would not permit
her to allow her name to remain on the list of subscribblers.' Last
night, at Lord H.'s&mdash;Mackintosh, the Ossulstones, Puys&eacute;gur, &amp;c. there&mdash;I
was trying to recollect a quotation (as <i>I</i> think) of Sta&euml;l's, from some
Teutonic sophist about architecture. 'Architecture,' says this
Macoronico Tedescho, 'reminds me of frozen music.' It is somewhere&mdash;but
where?&mdash;the demon of perplexity<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>Pg 263</span> must know and won't tell. I asked M.,
and he said it was not in her: but P&mdash;&mdash;r said it must be <i>hers</i>, it was
so <i>like</i>. H. laughed, as he does at all 'De l'Allemagne,'&mdash;in which,
however, I think he goes a little too far. B., I hear, condemns it too.
But there are fine passages;&mdash;and, after all, what is a work&mdash;any&mdash;or
every work&mdash;but a desert with fountains, and, perhaps, a grove or two,
every day's journey? To be sure, in Madame, what we often mistake, and
'pant for,' as the 'cooling stream,' turns out to be the '<i>mirage</i>'
(critic&egrave; <i>verbiage</i>); but we do, at last, get to something like the
temple of Jove Ammon, and then the waste we have passed is only
remembered to gladden the contrast.</p>

<p>"Called on C * *, to explain * * *. She is very beautiful, to my taste,
at least; for on coming home from abroad, I recollect being unable to
look at any woman but her&mdash;they were so fair, and unmeaning, and
<i>blonde</i>. The darkness and regularity of her features reminded me of my
'Jannat al Aden.' But this impression wore off; and now I can look at a
fair woman, without longing for a Houri. She was very good-tempered, and
every thing was explained.</p>

<p>"To-day, great news&mdash;'the Dutch have taken Holland,'&mdash;which, I suppose,
will be succeeded by the actual explosion of the Thames. Five provinces
have declared for young Stadt, and there will be inundation,
conflagration, constupration, consternation, and every sort of nation
and nations, fighting away, up to their knees, in the damnable quags of
this will-o'-the-wisp abode of Boors. It is said Bernadotte is amongst
them, too; and, as Orange will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>Pg 264</span> there soon, they will have (Crown)
Prince Stork and King Log in their Loggery at the same time. Two to one
on the new dynasty!</p>

<p>"Mr. Murray has offered me one thousand guineas for 'The Giaour' and
'The Bride of Abydos.' I won't&mdash;it is too much, though I am strongly
tempted, merely for the <i>say</i> of it. No bad price for a fortnight's (a
week each) what?&mdash;the gods know&mdash;it was intended to be called poetry.</p>

<p>"I have dined regularly to-day, for the first time since Sunday
last&mdash;this being Sabbath, too. All the rest, tea and dry biscuits&mdash;six
<i>per diem</i>, I wish to God I had not dined now!&mdash;It kills me with
heaviness, stupor, and horrible dreams;&mdash;and yet it was but a pint of
bucellas, and fish.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Meat I never touch,&mdash;nor much vegetable diet. I
wish I were in the country, to take exercise,&mdash;instead of being obliged
to cool by abstinence, in lieu of it. I should not so much mind a little
accession of flesh,&mdash;my bones can well bear it. But the worst is, the
devil always came with it,&mdash;till I starved him out,&mdash;and I will <i>not</i> be
the slave of <i>any</i> appetite. If I do err, it shall be my heart, at
least, that heralds the way. Oh, my head&mdash;how it aches?&mdash;the horrors of
digestion! I wonder how Buonaparte's dinner agrees with him?</p>

<p>"Mem. I must write to-morrow to 'Master Shallow, who owes me a thousand
pounds,' and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>Pg 265</span> seems, in his letter, afraid I should ask him for
it<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>;&mdash;as if I would!&mdash;I don't want it (just now, at least,) to begin
with; and though I have often wanted that sum, I never asked for the
repayment of 10<i>l.</i> in my life&mdash;from a friend. His bond is not due this
year, and I told him when it was, I should not enforce it. How often
must he make me say the same thing?</p>

<p>"I am wrong&mdash;I did once ask * * *<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> to repay me. But it was under
circumstances that excused me <i>to him</i>, and would to any one. I took no
interest, nor required security. He paid me soon,&mdash;at least, his
<i>padre</i>. My head! I believe it was given me to ache with. Good even.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nov. 22. 1813.</p>

<p>"'Orange Boven!' So the bees have expelled the bear that broke open
their hive. Well,&mdash;if we are to have new De Witts and De Ruyters, God
speed the little republic! I should like to see the Hague and the
village of Brock, where they have such primitive habits. Yet, I don't
know,&mdash;their canals would cut a poor figure by the memory of the
Bosphorus; and the Zuyder Zee look awkwardly after 'Ak-Denizi.' No
matter,&mdash;the bluff burghers, puffing freedom out of their short
tobacco-pipes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>Pg 266</span> might be worth seeing; though I prefer a cigar or a
hooka, with the rose-leaf mixed with the milder herb of the Levant. I
don't know what liberty means,&mdash;never having seen it,&mdash;but wealth is
power all over the world; and as a shilling performs the duty of a pound
(besides sun and sky and beauty for nothing) in the East,&mdash;<i>that</i> is the
country. How I envy Herodes Atticus!&mdash;more than Pomponius. And yet a
little <i>tumult</i>, now and then, is an agreeable quickener of sensation;
such as a revolution, a battle, or an <i>aventure</i> of any lively
description. I think I rather would have been Bonneval, Ripperda,
Alberoni, Hayreddin, or Horuc Barbarossa, or even Wortley Montague, than
Mahomet himself.</p>

<p>"Rogers will be in town soon?&mdash;the 23d is fixed for our Middleton visit.
Shall I go? umph!&mdash;In this island, where one can't ride out without
overtaking the sea, it don't much matter where one goes.</p>

<p>"I remember the effect of the <i>first</i> Edinburgh Review on me. I heard of
it six weeks before,&mdash;read it the day of its denunciation,&mdash;dined and
drank three bottles of claret, (with S.B. Davies, I think,) neither ate
nor slept the less, but, nevertheless, was not easy till I had vented my
wrath and my rhyme, in the same pages, against every thing and every
body. Like George, in the Vicar of Wakefield, 'the fate of my paradoxes'
would allow me to perceive no merit in another. I remembered only the
maxim of my boxing-master, which, in my youth, was found useful in all
general riots,&mdash;'Whoever is not for you is against you&mdash;<i>mill</i> away<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>Pg 267</span>
right and left,' and so I did;&mdash;like Ishmael, my hand was against all
men, and all men's anent me. I did wonder, to be sure, at my own
success&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'And marvels so much wit is all his own,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as Hobhouse sarcastically says of somebody (not unlikely myself, as we
are old friends);&mdash;but were it to come over again, I would <i>not</i>. I have
since redde<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> the cause of my couplets, and it is not adequate to the
effect. C * * told me that it was believed I alluded to poor Lord
Carlisle's nervous disorder in one of the lines. I thank Heaven I did
not know it&mdash;and would not, could not, if I had. I must naturally be the
last person to be pointed on defects or maladies.</p>

<p>"Rogers is silent,&mdash;and, it is said, severe. When he does talk, he talks
well; and, on all subjects of taste, his delicacy of expression is pure
as his poetry. If you enter his house&mdash;his drawing-room&mdash;his
library&mdash;you of yourself say, this is not the dwelling of a common mind.
There is not a gem, a coin, a book thrown aside on his chimney-piece,
his sofa, his table, that does not bespeak an almost fastidious elegance
in the possessor. But this very delicacy must be the misery of his
existence. Oh the jarrings his disposition must have encountered through
life!</p>

<p>"Southey, I have not seen much of. His appearance is <i>Epic</i>; and he is
the only existing entire man of letters. All the others have some
pursuit annexed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>Pg 268</span> to their authorship. His manners are mild, but not
those of a man of the world, and his talents of the first order. His
prose is perfect. Of his poetry there are various opinions: there is,
perhaps, too much of it for the present generation;&mdash;posterity will
probably select. He has passages equal to any thing. At present, he has
a party, but no public&mdash;except for his prose writings. The life of
Nelson is beautiful.</p>

<p>"* * is a <i>Litt&eacute;rateur</i>, the Oracle of the Coteries, of the * * s, L * W
* (Sydney Smith's 'Tory Virgin'), Mrs. Wilmot, (she, at least, is a
swan, and might frequent a purer stream,) Lady B * *, and all the Blues,
with Lady C * * at their head&mdash;but I say nothing of <i>her</i>&mdash;'look in her
face and you forget them all,' and every thing else. Oh that face!&mdash;by
'te, Diva potens Cypri,' I would, to be beloved by that woman, build and
burn another Troy.</p>

<p>"M * * e has a peculiarity of talent, or rather talents,&mdash;poetry, music,
voice, all his own; and an expression in each, which never was, nor will
be, possessed by another. But he is capable of still higher flights in
poetry. By the by, what humour, what&mdash;every thing, in the 'Post-Bag!'
There is nothing M * * e may not do, if he will but seriously set about
it. In society, he is gentlemanly, gentle, and, altogether, more
pleasing than any individual with whom I am acquainted. For his honour,

'trumpet-tongued.' He has but one fault&mdash;and that one I daily regret&mdash;he
is not <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>"Ward&mdash;I like Ward.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> By Mahomet! I begin to think I like every
body;&mdash;a disposition not to be encouraged;&mdash;a sort of social gluttony
that swallows every thing set before it. But I like Ward. He is
<i>piquant</i>; and, in my opinion, will stand <i>very</i> high in the House, and
every where else, if he applies regularly. By the by, I dine with him
to-morrow, which may have some influence on my opinion. It is as well
not to trust one's gratitude <i>after</i> dinner. I have heard many a host
libelled by his guests, with his burgundy yet reeking on their rascally
lips.</p>

<p>"I have taken Lord Salisbury's box at Covent Garden for the season; and
now I must go and prepare to join Lady Holland and party, in theirs, at
Drury Lane, <i>questa sera</i>.</p>

<p>"Holland doesn't think the man <i>is Junius</i>; but that the yet unpublished
journal throws great light on the obscurities of that part of George the
Second's reign&mdash;What is this to George the Third's? I don't know what to
think. Why should Junius be yet dead? If suddenly apoplexed, would he
rest in his grave without sending his &#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; to shout in the
ears of posterity, 'Junius was X.Y.Z., Esq., buried in the parish of * *
*. Repair his monument, ye churchwardens! Print a new edition of his
Letters, ye booksellers!' Impossible,&mdash;the man must be alive, and will
never die without the disclosure. I like him;&mdash;he was a good hater.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>Pg 270</span></p>

<p>"Came home unwell and went to bed,&mdash;not so sleepy as might be desirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"I awoke from a dream!&mdash;well! and have not others dreamed?&mdash;Such a
dream!&mdash;but she did not overtake me. I wish the dead would rest,
however. Ugh! how my blood chilled&mdash;and I could not wake
&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;heigho!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"'Shadows to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than could the substance of ten thousand * * s,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm'd all in proof, and led by shallow * *.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not like this dream,&mdash;I hate its 'foregone conclusion.' And am I to
be shaken by shadows? Ay, when they remind us of&mdash;no matter&mdash;but, if I
dream thus again, I will try whether <i>all</i> sleep has the like visions.
Since I rose, I've been in considerable bodily pain also; but it is
gone, and now, like Lord Ogleby, I am wound up for the day.</p>

<p>"A note from Mountnorris&mdash;I dine with Ward;&mdash;Canning is to be there,
Frere and Sharpe,&mdash;perhaps Gifford. I am to be one of 'the five' (or
rather six), as Lady * * said a little sneeringly yesterday. They are
all good to meet, particularly Canning, and&mdash;Ward, when he likes. I wish
I may be well enough to listen to these intellectuals.</p>

<p>"No letters to-day;&mdash;so much the better,&mdash;there are no answers. I must
not dream again;&mdash;it spoils even reality. I will go out of doors, and
see what the fog will do for me. Jackson has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>Pg 271</span> here: the boxing
world much as usual;&mdash;but the club increases. I shall dine at Crib's
to-morrow. I like energy&mdash;even animal energy&mdash;of all kinds; and I have
need of both mental and corporeal. I have not dined out, nor, indeed,
<i>at all</i>, lately; have heard no music&mdash;have seen nobody. Now for a
<i>plunge</i>&mdash;high life and low life. 'Amant <i>alterna</i> Camoen&aelig;!'</p>

<p>"I have burnt my <i>Roman</i>&mdash;as I did the first scenes and sketch of my
comedy&mdash;and, for aught I see, the pleasure of burning is quite as great
as that of printing. These two last would not have done. I ran into
realities more than ever; and some would have been recognised and others
guessed at.</p>

<p>"Redde the Ruminator&mdash;a collection of Essays, by a strange, but able,
old man (Sir E.B.), and a half-wild young one, author of a poem on the
Highlands, called 'Childe Alarique.' The word 'sensibility' (always my
aversion) occurs a thousand times in these Essays; and, it seems, is to
be an excuse for all kinds of discontent. This young man can know
nothing of life; and, if he cherishes the disposition which runs through
his papers, will become useless, and, perhaps, not even a poet, after
all, which he seems determined to be. God help him! no one should be a
rhymer who could be any thing better. And this is what annoys one, to
see Scott and Moore, and Campbell and Rogers, who might have all been
agents and leaders, now mere spectators. For, though they may have other
ostensible avocations, these last are reduced to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>Pg 272</span> secondary
consideration. * *, too, frittering away his time among dowagers and
unmarried girls. If it advanced any <i>serious</i> affair, it were some
excuse; but, with the unmarried, that is a hazardous speculation, and
tiresome enough, too; and, with the veterans, it is not much worth
trying, unless, perhaps, one in a thousand.</p>

<p>"If I had any views in this country, they would probably be
parliamentary. But I have no ambition; at least, if any, it would be
'aut C&aelig;sar aut nihil.' My hopes are limited to the arrangement of my
affairs, and settling either in Italy or the East (rather the last), and
drinking deep of the languages and literature of both. Past events have
unnerved me; and all I can now do is to make life an amusement, and look
on while others play. After all, even the highest game of crowns and
sceptres, what is it? <i>Vide</i> Napoleon's last twelve-month. It has
completely upset my system of fatalism. I thought, if crushed, he would
have fallen, when 'fractus illabitur orbis,' and not have been pared
away to gradual insignificance; that all this was not a mere <i>jeu</i> of
the gods, but a prelude to greater changes and mightier events. But men
never advance beyond a certain point; and here we are, retrograding to
the dull, stupid old system,&mdash;balance of Europe&mdash;poising straws upon
kings' noses, instead of wringing them off! Give me a republic, or a
despotism of one, rather than the mixed government of one, two, three. A
republic!&mdash;look in the history of the Earth&mdash;Rome, Greece, Venice,
France, Holland, America, our short (eheu!)<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>Pg 273</span> Commonwealth, and compare
it with what they did under masters. The Asiatics are not qualified to
be republicans, but they have the liberty of demolishing despots, which
is the next thing to it. To be the first man&mdash;not the Dictator&mdash;not the
Sylla, but the Washington or the Aristides&mdash;the leader in talent and
truth&mdash;is next to the Divinity! Franklin, Penn, and, next to these,
either Brutus or Cassius&mdash;even Mirabeau&mdash;or St. Just. I shall never be
any thing, or rather always be nothing. The most I can hope is, that
some will say, 'He might, perhaps, if he would.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"12, midnight.</p>

<p>"Here are two confounded proofs from the printer. I have looked at the
one, but for the soul of me, I can't look over that 'Giaour' again,&mdash;at
least, just now, and at this hour&mdash;and yet there is no moon.</p>

<p>"Ward talks of going to Holland, and we have partly discussed an
ensemble expedition. It must be in ten days, if at all, if we wish to be
in at the Revolution. And why not? * * is distant, and will be at * *,
still more distant, till spring. No one else, except Augusta, cares for
me; no ties&mdash;no trammels&mdash;<i>andiamo dunque&mdash;se torniamo, bene&mdash;se non,
ch' importa</i>? Old William of Orange talked of dying in 'the last ditch'
of his dingy country. It is lucky I can swim, or I suppose I should not
well weather the first. But let us see. I have heard hy&aelig;nas and jackalls
in the ruins of Asia; and bull-frogs in the marshes; besides wolves<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>Pg 274</span> and
angry Mussulmans. Now, I should like to listen to the shout of a free
Dutchman.</p>

<p>"Alla! Viva! For ever! Hourra! Huzza!&mdash;which is the most rational or
musical of these cries? 'Orange Boven,' according to the Morning Post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 24.</p>

<p>"No dreams last night of the dead nor the living, so&mdash;I am 'firm as the
marble, founded as the rock,' till the next earthquake.</p>

<p>"Ward's dinner went off well. There was not a disagreeable person
there&mdash;unless <i>I</i> offended any body, which I am sure I could not by
contradiction, for I said little, and opposed nothing. Sharpe (a man of
elegant mind, and who has lived much with the best&mdash;Fox, Horne Tooke,
Windham, Fitzpatrick, and all the agitators of other times and tongues,)
told us the particulars of his last interview with Windham, a few days
before the fatal operation which sent 'that gallant spirit to aspire the
skies.' Windham,&mdash;the first in one department of oratory and talent,
whose only fault was his refinement beyond the intellect of half his
hearers,&mdash;Windham, half his life an active participator in the events of
the earth, and one of those who governed nations,&mdash;<i>he</i> regretted, and
dwelt much on that regret, that 'he had not entirely devoted himself to
literature and science!!!' His mind certainly would have carried him to
eminence there, as elsewhere;&mdash;but I cannot comprehend what debility of
that mind could suggest such a wish. I, who have heard him, cannot
regret any thing but that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>Pg 275</span> shall never hear him again. What! would he
have been a plodder? a metaphysician?&mdash;perhaps a rhymer? a scribbler?
Such an exchange must have been suggested by illness. But he is gone,
and Time 'shall not look upon his like again.'</p>

<p>"I am tremendously in arrear with my letters,&mdash;except to * *, and to her
my thoughts overpower me:&mdash;my words never compass them. To Lady
Melbourne I write with most pleasure&mdash;and her answers, so sensible, so
<i>tactique</i>&mdash;I never met with half her talent. If she had been a few
years younger, what a fool she would have made of me, had she thought it
worth her while,&mdash;and I should have lost a valuable and most agreeable
friend. Mem. a mistress never is nor can be a friend. While you agree,
you are lovers; and, when it is over, any thing but friends.</p>

<p>"I have not answered W. Scott's last letter,&mdash;but I will. I regret to
hear from others that he has lately been unfortunate in pecuniary
involvements. He is undoubtedly the Monarch of Parnassus, and the most
<i>English</i> of bards. I should place Rogers next in the living list (I
value him more as the last of the best school)&mdash;Moore and Campbell both
<i>third</i>&mdash;Southey and Wordsworth and Coleridge&mdash;the
rest, &#8001;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;&mdash;thus:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>Pg 276</span></p>

<p>There is a triangular 'Gradus ad Parnassum!'&mdash;the names are too numerous
for the base of the triangle. Poor Thurlow has gone wild about the
poetry of Queen Bess's reign&mdash;<i>c'est dommage</i>. I have ranked the names
upon my triangle more upon what I believe popular opinion, than any
decided opinion of my own. For, to me, some of M * * e's last <i>Erin</i>
sparks&mdash;'As a beam o'er the face of the waters'&mdash;'When he who adores
thee'&mdash;'Oh blame not'&mdash;and 'Oh breathe not his name'&mdash;are worth all the
Epics that ever were composed.</p>

<p>"* * thinks the Quarterly will attack me next. Let them. I have been
'peppered so highly' in my time, both ways, that it must be cayenne or
aloes to make me taste. I can sincerely say that I am not very much
alive <i>now</i> to criticism. But&mdash;in tracing this&mdash;I rather believe, that
it proceeds from my not attaching that importance to author<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>Pg 277</span>ship which
many do, and which, when young, I did also. 'One gets tired of every
thing, my angel,' says Valmont. The 'angels' are the only things of
which I am not a little sick&mdash;but I do think the preference of <i>writers</i>
to <i>agents</i>&mdash;the mighty stir made about scribbling and scribes, by
themselves and others&mdash;a sign of effeminacy, degeneracy, and weakness.
Who would write, who had any thing better to do?
'Action&mdash;action&mdash;action'&mdash;said Demosthenes: 'Actions&mdash;actions,' I say,
and not writing,&mdash;least of all, rhyme. Look at the querulous and
monotonous lives of the 'genus;'&mdash;except Cervantes, Tasso, Dante,
Ariosto, Kleist (who were brave and active citizens), Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and some other of the antiques also&mdash;what a worthless, idle
brood it is!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"12, Mezza notte.</p>

<p>"Just returned from dinner with Jackson (the Emperor of Pugilism) and
another of the select, at Crib's the champion's. I drank more than I
like, and have brought away some three bottles of very fair claret&mdash;for
I have no headach. We had Tom * * up after dinner;&mdash;very facetious,
though somewhat prolix. He don't like his situation&mdash;wants to fight
again&mdash;pray Pollux (or Castor, if he was the <i>miller</i>) he may! Tom has
been a sailor&mdash;a coal heaver&mdash;and some other genteel profession, before
he took to the cestus. Tom has been in action at sea, and is now only
three-and-thirty. A great man! has a wife and a mistress, and
conversations<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>Pg 278</span> well&mdash;bating some sad omissions and misapplications of
the aspirate. Tom is an old friend of mine; I have seen some of his best
battles in my nonage. He is now a publican, and, I fear, a sinner;&mdash;for
Mrs. * * is on alimony, and * *'s daughter lives with the champion.
<i>This</i> * * told me,&mdash;Tom, having an opinion of my morals, passed her off
as a legal spouse. Talking of her, he said, 'she was the truest of
women'&mdash;from which I immediately inferred she could not be his wife, and
so it turned out.</p>

<p>"These panegyrics don't belong to matrimony;&mdash;for, if 'true,' a man
don't think it necessary to say so; and if not, the less he says the
better. * * * * is the only man, except * * * *, I ever heard harangue
upon his wife's virtue; and I listened to both with great credence and
patience, and stuffed my handkerchief into my mouth, when I found
yawning irresistible.&mdash;By the by, I am yawning now&mdash;so, good night to
thee.&mdash;&#925;&#969;&#7937;&#953;&#961;&#969;&#957;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thursday, November 26.</p>

<p>"Awoke a little feverish, but no headach&mdash;no dreams neither, thanks to
stupor! Two letters; one from * * * *'s, the other from Lady
Melbourne&mdash;both excellent in their respective styles. * * * *'s
contained also a very pretty lyric on 'concealed griefs;' if not her
own, yet very like her. Why did she not say that the stanzas were, or
were not, of her composition? I do not know whether to wish them hers or
not. I have no great esteem for poetical persons, particularly women;
they have so much of the 'ideal' in <i>practics</i>, as well as <i>ethics</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>Pg 279</span></p>

<p>"I have been thinking lately a good deal of Mary Duff, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.

<p>"Lord Holland invited me to dinner to-day; but three days' dining would
destroy me. So, without eating at all since yesterday, I went to my box
at Covent Garden.</p>

<p>"Saw * * * * looking very pretty, though quite a different style of
beauty from the other two. She has the finest eyes in the world, out of
which she pretends <i>not</i> to see, and the longest eyelashes I ever saw,
since Leila's and Phannio's Moslem curtains of the light. She has much
beauty,&mdash;just enough,&mdash;but is, I think, <i>m&eacute;chante</i>.</p>

<p>"I have been pondering on the miseries of separation, that&mdash;oh how
seldom we see those we love! yet we live ages in moments, <i>when met</i>.
The only thing that consoles me during absence is the reflection that no
mental or personal estrangement, from ennui or disagreement, can take
place; and when people meet hereafter, even though many changes may have
taken place in the mean time, still, unless they are <i>tired</i> of each
other, they are ready to reunite, and do not blame each other for the
circumstances that severed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Saturday 27. (I believe&mdash;or rather am in <i>doubt</i>, which is the ne plus
ultra of mortal faith.)</p>

<p>"I have missed a day; and, as the Irishman said, or Joe Miller says for
him, 'have gained a loss,' or <i>by</i> the loss. Every thing is settled for
Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>Pg 280</span> and nothing but a cough, or a caprice of my
fellow-traveller's, can stop us. Carriage ordered, funds prepared, and,
probably, a gale of wind into the bargain. <i>N'importe</i>&mdash;I believe, with
Clym o' the Clow, or Robin Hood, 'By our Mary, (dear name!) that art
both Mother and May, I think it never was a man's lot to die before this
day.' Heigh for Helvoetsluys, and so forth!</p>

<p>"To-night I went with young Henry Fox to see 'Nourjahad,' a drama, which
the Morning Post hath laid to my charge, but of which I cannot even
guess the author. I wonder what they will next inflict upon me. They
cannot well sink below a melodrama; but that is better than a Satire,
(at least, a personal one,) with which I stand truly arraigned, and in
atonement of which I am resolved to bear silently all criticisms,
abuses, and even praises, for bad pantomimes never composed by me,
without even a contradictory aspect. I suppose the root of this report
is my loan to the manager of my Turkish drawings for his dresses, to
which he was more welcome than to my name. I suppose the real author
will soon own it, as it has succeeded; if not, Job be my model, and
Lethe my beverage!</p>

<p>"* * * * has received the portrait safe; and, in answer, the only remark
she makes upon it is, 'indeed it is like'&mdash;and again, 'indeed it is
like.' With her the likeness 'covered a multitude of sins;' for I happen
to know that this portrait was not a flatterer, but dark and
stern,&mdash;even black as the mood in which my mind was scorching last July,
when I sat for it. All the others of me, like most portraits<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>Pg 281</span>
whatsoever, are, of course, more agreeable than nature.</p>

<p>"Redde the Ed. Review of Rogers. He is ranked highly; but where he
should be. There is a summary view of us all&mdash;<i>Moore</i> and <i>me</i> among the
rest; and both (the <i>first</i> justly) praised&mdash;though, by implication
(justly again) placed beneath our memorable friend. Mackintosh is the
writer, and also of the critique on the Sta&euml;l. His grand essay on Burke,
I hear, is for the next number. But I know nothing of the Edinburgh, or
of any other Review, but from rumour; and I have long ceased&mdash;indeed, I
could not, in justice, complain of any, even though I were to rate
poetry, in general, and my rhymes in particular, more highly than I
really do. To withdraw <i>myself</i> from <i>myself</i> (oh that cursed
selfishness!) has ever been my sole, my entire, my sincere motive in
scribbling at all; and publishing is also the continuance of the same
object, by the action it affords to the mind, which else recoils upon
itself. If I valued fame, I should flatter received opinions, which have
gathered strength by time, and will yet wear longer than any living
works to the contrary. But, for the soul of me, I cannot and will not
give the lie to my own thoughts and doubts, come what may. If I am a
fool, it is, at least, a doubting one; and I envy no one the certainty
of his self-approved wisdom.</p>

<p>"All are inclined to believe what they covet, from a lottery-ticket up
to a passport to Paradise,&mdash;in which, from the description, I see
nothing very tempting. My restlessness tells me I have some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>Pg 282</span>thing within
that 'passeth show.' It is for Him, who made it, to prolong that spark
of celestial fire which illuminates, yet burns, this frail tenement; but
I see no such horror in a 'dreamless sleep,' and I have no conception of
any existence which duration would not render tiresome. How else 'fell
the angels,' even according to your creed? They were immortal, heavenly,
and happy as their <i>apostate</i> <i>Abdiel</i> is now by his treachery. Time
must decide; and eternity won't be the less agreeable or more horrible
because one did not expect it. In the mean time, I am grateful for some
good, and tolerably patient under certain evils&mdash;grace &agrave; Dieu et mon bon
temp&eacute;rament.</p>

<p>"Two days missed in my log-book;&mdash;hiatus <i>haud</i> deflendus. They were as
little worth recollection as the rest; and, luckily, laziness or society
prevented me from <i>notching</i> them.</p>

<p>"Sunday, I dined with the Lord Holland in St. James's Square. Large
party&mdash;among them Sir S. Romilly and Lady R<sup>y</sup>.&mdash;General Sir Somebody
Bentham, a man of science and talent, I am told&mdash;Horner&mdash;<i>the</i> Horner,
an Edinburgh Reviewer, an excellent speaker in the 'Honourable House,'
very pleasing, too, and gentlemanly in company, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>Pg 283</span> I have
seen&mdash;Sharpe&mdash;Phillips of Lancashire&mdash;Lord John Russell, and others,
'good men and true.' Holland's society is very good; you always see some
one or other in it worth knowing. Stuffed myself with sturgeon, and
exceeded in champagne and wine in general, but not to confusion of head.
When I <i>do</i> dine, I gorge like an Arab or a Boa snake, on fish and
vegetables, but no meat. I am always better, however, on my tea and
biscuit than any other regimen, and even <i>that</i> sparingly.</p>

<p>"Why does Lady H. always have that damned screen between the whole room
and the fire? I, who bear cold no better than an antelope, and never yet
found a sun quite <i>done</i> to my taste, was absolutely petrified, and
could not even shiver. All the rest, too, looked as if they were just
unpacked, like salmon from an ice-basket, and set down to table for that
day only. When she retired, I watched their looks as I dismissed the
screen, and every cheek thawed, and every nose reddened with the
anticipated glow.</p>

<p>"Saturday, I went with Harry Fox to Nourjahad; and, I believe, convinced
him, by incessant yawning, that it was not mine. I wish the precious
author would own it, and release me from his fame. The dresses are
pretty, but not in costume;&mdash;Mrs. Horn's, all but the turban, and the
want of a small dagger (if she is a sultana), <i>perfect</i>. I never saw a
Turkish woman with a turban in my life&mdash;nor did any one else. The
sultanas have a small poniard at the waist. The dialogue is drowsy&mdash;the
action<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>Pg 284</span> heavy&mdash;the scenery fine&mdash;the actors tolerable. I can't say much
for their seraglio&mdash;Teresa, Phannio, or * * * *, were worth them all.</p>

<p>"Sunday, a very handsome note from Mackintosh, who is a rare instance of
the union of very transcendent talent and great good nature. To-day
(Tuesday) a very pretty billet from M. la Baronne de Sta&euml;l Holstein. She
is pleased to be much pleased with my mention of her and her last work
in my notes. I spoke as I thought. Her works are my delight, and so is
she herself, for&mdash;half an hour. I don't like her politics&mdash;at least, her
<i>having changed</i> them; had she been <i>qualis ab incepto</i>, it were
nothing. But she is a woman by herself, and has done more than all the
rest of them together, intellectually;&mdash;she ought to have been a man.
She <i>flatters</i> me very prettily in her note;&mdash;but I <i>know</i> it. The
reason that adulation is not displeasing is, that, though untrue, it
shows one to be of consequence enough, in one way or other, to induce
people to lie, to make us their friend:&mdash;that is their concern.</p>

<p>"* * is, I hear, thriving on the repute of a pun which was mine (at
Mackintosh's dinner some time back), on Ward, who was asking 'how much
it would take to <i>re-whig</i> him?' I answered that, probably, 'he must
first, before he was <i>re-whigged</i>, be re-<i>warded</i>.' This foolish
quibble, before the Sta&euml;l and Mackintosh, and a number of
conversationers, has been mouthed about, and at last settled on the head
of * *, where long may it remain!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>Pg 285</span></p>

like their heirs. He is a fine fellow, and every inch a sailor. I would
do any thing, <i>but apostatise</i>, to get him on in his profession.</p>

<p>"Lewis called. It is a good and good-humoured man, but pestilently
prolix and paradoxical and <i>personal</i>. If he would but talk half, and
reduce his visits to an hour, he would add to his popularity. As an
author he is very good, and his vanity is <i>ouverte</i>, like Erskine's, and
yet not offending.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, a very pretty letter from Annabella<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, which I answered.
What an odd situation and friendship is ours!&mdash;without one spark of love
on either side, and produced by circumstances which in general lead to
coldness on one side, and aversion on the other. She is a very superior
woman, and very little spoiled, which is strange in an heiress&mdash;girl of
twenty&mdash;a peeress that is to be, in her own right&mdash;an only child, and a
<i>savante</i>, who has always had her own way. She is a poetess&mdash;a
mathematician&mdash;a metaphysician, and yet, withal, very kind, generous,
and gentle, with very little pretension. Any other head would be turned
with half her acquisitions, and a tenth of her advantages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 1. 1813.</p>

<p>"To-day responded to La Baronne de Sta&euml;l Holstein, and sent to Leigh
Hunt (an acquisition to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>Pg 286</span> my acquaintance&mdash;through Moore&mdash;of last summer)
a copy of the two Turkish tales. Hunt is an extraordinary character, and
not exactly of the present age. He reminds me more of the Pym and
Hampden times&mdash;much talent, great independence of spirit, and an
austere, yet not repulsive, aspect. If he goes on <i>qualis ab incepto</i>, I
know few men who will deserve more praise or obtain it. I must go and
see him again;&mdash;the rapid succession of adventure, since last summer,
added to some serious uneasiness and business, have interrupted our
acquaintance; but he is a man worth knowing; and though, for his own
sake, I wish him out of prison, I like to study character in such
situations. He has been unshaken, and will continue so. I don't think
him deeply versed in life;&mdash;he is the bigot of virtue (not religion),
and enamoured of the beauty of that 'empty name,' as the last breath of
Brutus pronounced, and every day proves it. He is, perhaps, a little
opiniated, as all men who are the <i>centre</i> of <i>circles</i>, wide or
narrow&mdash;the Sir Oracles, in whose name two or three are gathered
together&mdash;must be, and as even Johnson was; but, withal, a valuable man,
and less vain than success and even the consciousness of preferring 'the
right to the expedient' might excuse.</p>

<p>"To-morrow there is a party of <i>purple</i> at the 'blue' Miss * * *'s.
Shall I go? um!&mdash;I don't much affect your blue-bottles;&mdash;but one ought
to be civil. There will be, 'I guess now' (as the Americans say), the
Sta&euml;ls and Mackintoshes&mdash;good&mdash;the * * * s and * * * s&mdash;not so good&mdash;the
* * * s,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>Pg 287</span> &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;good for nothing. Perhaps that blue-winged Kashmirian
butterfly of book-learning, Lady * * * *, will be there. I hope so; it
is a pleasure to look upon that most beautiful of faces.</p>

<p>"Wrote to H.:&mdash;he has been telling that I &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. I am sure, at
least, <i>I</i> did not mention it, and I wish he had not. He is a good
fellow, and I obliged myself ten times more by being of use than I did
him,&mdash;and there's an end on 't.</p>

<p>"Baldwin is boring me to present their King's Bench petition. I
presented Cartwright's last year; and Stanhope and I stood against the
whole House, and mouthed it valiantly&mdash;and had some fun and a little
abuse for our opposition. But 'I am not i' th' vein' for this business.
Now, had * * been here, she would have <i>made</i> me do it. <i>There</i> is a
woman, who, amid all her fascination, always urged a man to usefulness
or glory. Had she remained, she had been my tutelar genius.</p>

<p>"Baldwin is very importunate&mdash;but, poor fellow, 'I can't get out, I
can't get out&mdash;said the starling.' Ah, I am as bad as that dog Sterne,
who preferred whining over 'a dead ass to relieving a living
mother'&mdash;villain&mdash;hypocrite&mdash;slave&mdash;sycophant! but <i>I</i> am no better.
Here I cannot stimulate myself to a speech for the sake of these
unfortunates, and three words and half a smile of * * had she been here
to urge it, (and urge it she infallibly would&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>Pg 288</span>at least she always
pressed me on senatorial duties, and particularly in the cause of
weakness,) would have made me an advocate, if not an orator. Curse on
Rochefoucault for being always right! In him a lie were virtue,&mdash;or, at
least, a comfort to his readers.</p>

<p>"George Byron has not called to-day; I hope he will be an admiral, and,
perhaps, Lord Byron into the bargain. If he would but marry, I would
engage never to marry myself, or cut him out of the heirship. He would
be happier, and I should like nephews better than sons.</p>

<p>"I shall soon be six-and-twenty (January 22d, 1814). Is there any thing
in the future that can possibly console us for not being always
<i>twenty-five</i>?</p>

<p>"Sunday, December 5.</p>

<p>"Dallas's nephew (son to the American Attorney-general) is arrived in
this country, and tells Dallas that my rhymes are very popular in the
United States. These are the first tidings that have ever sounded like
<i>Fame</i> to my ears&mdash;to be redde on the banks of the Ohio! The greatest
pleasure I ever derived, of this kind, was from an extract, in Cooke the
actor's life, from his Journal, stating that in the reading-room at
Albany, near Washington, he perused English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.
To be popular in a rising and far country has a kind of <i>posthumous
feel</i>, very different from the ephemeral<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>Pg 289</span> <i>&eacute;clat</i> and f&ecirc;te-ing, buzzing
and party-ing compliments of the well-dressed multitude. I can safely
say that, during my <i>reign</i> in the spring of 1812, I regretted nothing
but its duration of six weeks instead of a fortnight, and was heartily
glad to resign.</p>

<p>"Last night I supped with Lewis;&mdash;and, as usual, though I neither
exceeded in solids nor fluids, have been half dead ever since. My
stomach is entirely destroyed by long abstinence, and the rest will
probably follow. Let it&mdash;I only wish the <i>pain</i> over. The 'leap in the
dark' is the least to be dreaded.</p>

<p>"The Duke of * * called. I have told them forty times that, except to
half-a-dozen old and specified acquaintances, I am invisible. His Grace
is a good, noble, ducal person; but I am content to think so at a
distance, and so&mdash;I was not at home.</p>

<p>"Galt called.&mdash;Mem.&mdash;to ask some one to speak to Raymond in favour of
his play. We are old fellow-travellers, and, with all his
eccentricities, he has much strong sense, experience of the world, and
is, as far as I have seen, a good-natured philosophical fellow. I showed
him Sligo's letter on the reports of the Turkish girl's <i>aventure</i> at
Athens soon after it happened. He and Lord Holland, Lewis, and Moore,
and Rogers, and Lady Melbourne have seen it. Murray has a copy. I
thought it had been <i>unknown</i>, and wish it were; but Sligo arrived only
some days after, and the <i>rumours</i> are the subject of his letter. That I
shall preserve,&mdash;<i>it is as well</i>. Lewis and Galt were both <i>horrified</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>Pg 290</span>
and L. wondered I did not introduce the situation into 'The Giaour.' He
<i>may</i> wonder;&mdash;he might wonder more at that production's being written
at all. But to describe the <i>feelings of that situation</i> were
impossible&mdash;it is <i>icy</i> even to recollect them.</p>

<p>"The Bride of Abydos was published on Thursday the second of December;
but how it is liked or disliked, I know not. Whether it succeeds or not
is no fault of the public, against whom I can have no complaint. But I
am much more indebted to the tale than I can ever be to the most partial
reader; as it wrung my thoughts from reality to imagination&mdash;from
selfish regrets to vivid recollections&mdash;and recalled me to a country
replete with the <i>brightest</i> and <i>darkest</i>, but always most <i>lively</i>
colours of my memory. Sharpe called, but was not let in&mdash;which I regret.</p>

<p>"Saw * * yesterday. I have not kept my appointment at Middleton, which
has not pleased him, perhaps; and my projected voyage with * * will,
perhaps, please him less. But I wish to keep well with both. They are
instruments that don't do, in concert; but, surely, their separate tones
are very musical, and I won't give up either.</p>

<p>"It is well if I don't jar between these great discords. At present I
stand tolerably well with all, but I cannot adopt their <i>dislikes</i>;&mdash;so
many <i>sets</i>. Holland's is the first;&mdash;every thing <i>distingu&eacute;</i> is welcome
there, and certainly the <i>ton</i> of his society is the best. Then there is
M<sup>de</sup>. de Sta&euml;l's&mdash;there I never go, though I might, had I courted it. It
is composed of the * *'s and the * * family, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>Pg 291</span> strange
sprinkling,&mdash;orators, dandies, and all kinds of <i>Blue</i>, from the regular
Grub Street uniform, down to the azure jacket of the <i>Litt&eacute;rateur</i>. To
see * * and * * sitting together, at dinner, always reminds me of the
grave, where all distinctions of friend and foe are levelled; and
they&mdash;the Reviewer and Review&eacute;e&mdash;the Rhinoceros and Elephant&mdash;the
Mammoth and Megalonyx&mdash;all will lie quietly together. They now <i>sit</i>
together, as silent, but not so quiet, as if they were already immured.</p>

<p>"I did not go to the Berrys' the other night. The elder is a woman of
much talent, and both are handsome, and must have been beautiful.
To-night asked to Lord H.'s&mdash;shall I go? um!&mdash;perhaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Morning, two o'clock.</p>

<p>"Went to Lord H.'s&mdash;party numerous&mdash;<i>mi</i>lady in perfect good humour, and
consequently <i>perfect</i>. No one more agreeable, or perhaps so much so,
when she will. Asked for Wednesday to dine and meet the Sta&euml;l&mdash;asked
particularly, I believe, out of mischief, to see the first interview
after the <i>note</i>, with which Corinne professes herself to be so much
taken. I don't much like it; she always talks of <i>my</i>self or <i>her</i>self,
and I am not (except in soliloquy, as now,) much enamoured of either
subject&mdash;especially one's works. What the devil shall I say about 'De
l'Allemagne?' I like it prodigiously; but unless I can twist my
admiration into some fantastical expression, she won't believe me; and I
know, by experience, I shall be overwhelmed with fine things about
rhyme, &amp;c. &amp;c. The lover, Mr. * *, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>Pg 292</span> there to-night, and C * * said
'it was the only proof <i>he</i> had seen of her good taste.' Monsieur
L'Amant is remarkably handsome; but <i>I</i> don't think more so than her
book.</p>

<p>"C * * looks well,&mdash;seems pleased, and dressed to <i>sprucery</i>. A blue
coat becomes him,&mdash;so does his new wig. He really looked as if Apollo
had sent him a birthday suit, or a wedding-garment, and was witty and
lively. He abused Corinne's book, which I regret; because, firstly, he
understands German, and is consequently a fair judge; and, secondly, he
is <i>first-rate</i>, and, consequently, the best of judges. I reverence and
admire him; but I won't give up my opinion&mdash;why should I? I read <i>her</i>
again and again, and there can be no affectation in this. I cannot be
mistaken (except in taste) in a book I read and lay down, and take up
again; and no book can be totally bad which finds <i>one</i>, even <i>one</i>
reader, who can say as much sincerely.</p>

<p>"C. talks of lecturing next spring; his last lectures were eminently
successful. Moore thought of it, but gave it up,&mdash;I don't know why. * *
had been prating <i>dignity</i> to him, and such stuff; as if a man disgraced
himself by instructing and pleasing at the same time.</p>

<p>"Introduced to Marquis Buckingham&mdash;saw Lord Gower&mdash;he is going to
Holland; Sir J. and Lady Mackintosh and Homer, G. Lamb, with I know not
how many (R. Wellesley, one&mdash;a clever man) grouped about the room.
Little Henry Fox, a very fine boy, and very promising in mind and
manner,&mdash;he went away to bed, before I had time to talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>Pg 293</span> to him. I am
sure I had rather hear him than all the <i>savans</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Monday, Dec. 6.</p>

<p>"Murray tells me that C&mdash;&mdash;r asked him why the thing was called the
<i>Bride</i> of Abydos? It is a cursed awkward question, being unanswerable.
<i>She</i> is not a <i>bride</i>, only about to be one; but for, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at his finding out the <i>Bull</i>; but the detection * * *
is too late to do any good. I was a great fool to make it, and am
ashamed of not being an Irishman.</p>

<p>"C&mdash;&mdash;l last night seemed a little nettled at something or other&mdash;I know
not what. We were standing in the ante-saloon, when Lord H. brought out
of the other room a vessel of some composition similar to that which is
used in Catholic churches, and, seeing us, he exclaimed, 'Here is some
<i>incense</i> for you.' C&mdash;&mdash;l answered&mdash;'Carry it to Lord Byron, <i>he is
used to it</i>.'</p>

<p>"Now, this comes of 'bearing no brother near the throne.' I, who have no
throne, nor wish to have one <i>now</i>, whatever I may have done, am at
perfect peace with all the poetical fraternity: or, at least, if I
dislike any, it is not <i>poetically</i>, but <i>personally</i>. Surely the field
of thought is infinite; what does it signify who is before or behind in
a race where there is no <i>goal</i>? The temple of fame is like that of the
Persians, the universe; our altar, the tops of mountains. I should be
equally content with Mount Caucasus, or Mount Anything; and those who
like<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>Pg 294</span> it, may have Mount Blanc or Chimborazo, without my envy of their
elevation.</p>

<p>"I think I may <i>now</i> speak thus; for I have just published a poem, and
am quite ignorant whether it is <i>likely</i> to be <i>liked</i> or not. I have
hitherto heard little in its commendation, and no one can <i>downright</i>
abuse it to one's face, except in print. It can't be good, or I should
not have stumbled over the threshold, and blundered in my very title.
But I began it with my heart full of * * *, and my head of
oriental<i>ities</i> (I can't call them <i>isms</i>), and wrote on rapidly.</p>

<p>"This journal is a relief. When I am tired&mdash;as I generally am&mdash;out comes
this, and down goes every thing. But I can't read it over; and God knows
what contradictions it may contain. If I am sincere with myself (but I
fear one lies more to one's self than to any one else), every page
should confute, refute, and utterly abjure its <i>predecessor</i>.</p>

<p>"Another scribble from Martin Baldwin the petitioner; I have neither
head nor nerves to present it. That confounded supper at Lewis's has
spoiled my digestion and my philanthropy. I have no more charity than a
cruet of vinegar. Would I were an ostrich, and dieted on fire-irons,&mdash;or
any thing that my gizzard could get the better of.</p>

<p>"To-day saw W. His uncle is dying, and W. don't much affect our Dutch
determinations. I dine with him on Thursday, provided <i>l'oncle</i> is not
dined upon, or peremptorily bespoke by the posthumous epicures before
that day. I wish he may recover&mdash;not for <i>our</i> dinner's sake, but to
disappoint the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>Pg 295</span> undertaker, and the rascally reptiles that may well
wait, since they <i>will</i> dine at last.</p>

<p>"Gell called&mdash;he of Troy&mdash;after I was out. Mem.&mdash;to return his visit.
But my Mems. are the very land-marks of forgetfulness;&mdash;something like a
light-house, with a ship wrecked under the nose of its lantern. I never
look at a Mem. without seeing that I have remembered to forget. Mem.&mdash;I
have forgotten to pay Pitt's taxes, and suppose I shall be surcharged.
'An I do not turn rebel when thou art king'&mdash;oons! I believe my very
biscuit is leavened with that impostor's imposts.</p>

<p>"L<sup>y</sup>. M<sup>e</sup>. returns from Jersey's to-morrow;&mdash;I must call. A Mr. Thomson
has sent a song, which I must applaud. I hate annoying them with censure
or silence;&mdash;and yet I hate <i>lettering</i>.</p>

<p>"Saw Lord Glenbervie and his Prospectus, at Murray's, of a new Treatise
on Timber. Now here is a man more useful than all the historians and
rhymers ever planted. For, by preserving our woods and forests, he
furnishes materials for all the history of Britain worth reading, and
all the odes worth nothing.</p>

<p>"Redde a good deal, but desultorily. My head is crammed with the most
useless lumber. It is odd that when I do read, I can only bear the
chicken broth of&mdash;<i>any thing</i> but Novels. It is many a year since I
looked into one, (though they are sometimes ordered, by way of
experiment, but never taken,) till I looked yesterday at the worst parts
of the Monk. These descriptions ought to have been written by Tiberius
at Caprea&mdash;they are forced&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>Pg 296</span>the <i>philtred</i> ideas of a jaded voluptuary.
It is to me inconceivable how they could have been composed by a man of
only twenty&mdash;his age when he wrote them. They have no nature&mdash;all the
sour cream of cantharides. I should have suspected Buffon of writing
them on the death-bed of his detestable dotage. I had never redde this
edition, and merely looked at them from curiosity and recollection of
the noise they made, and the name they have left to Lewis. But they
could do no harm, except * * * *.</p>

<p>"Called this evening on my agent&mdash;my business as usual. Our strange
adventures are the only inheritances of our family that have not
diminished.</p>

<p>"I shall now smoke two cigars, and get me to bed. The cigars don't keep
well here. They get as old as a <i>donna di quaranti anni</i> in the sun of
Africa. The Havannah are the best;&mdash;but neither are so pleasant as a
hooka or chibouque. The Turkish tobacco is mild, and their horses
entire&mdash;two things as they should be. I am so far obliged to this
Journal, that it preserves me from verse,&mdash;at least from keeping it. I
have just thrown a poem into the fire (which it has relighted to my
great comfort), and have smoked out of my head the plan of another. I
wish I could as easily get rid of thinking, or, at least, the confusion
of thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Tuesday, December 7.</p>

<p>"Went to bed, and slept dreamlessly, but not refreshingly. Awoke, and up
an hour before being called; but dawdled three hours in dressing. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>Pg 297</span>
one subtracts from life infancy (which is vegetation),&mdash;sleep, eating,
and swilling&mdash;buttoning and unbuttoning&mdash;how much remains of downright
existence? The summer of a dormouse.</p>

<p>"Redde the papers and <i>tea</i>-ed and soda-watered, and found out that the
fire was badly lighted. Ld. Glenbervie wants me to go to Brighton&mdash;um!</p>

<p>"This morning, a very pretty billet from the Sta&euml;l about meeting her at
Ld. H.'s to-morrow. She has written, I dare say, twenty such this
morning to different people, all equally flattering to each. So much the
better for her and those who believe all she wishes them, or they wish
to believe. She has been pleased to be pleased with my slight eulogy in
the note annexed to 'The Bride.' This is to be accounted for in several
ways,&mdash;firstly, all women like all, or any, praise; secondly, this was
unexpected, because I have never courted her; and, thirdly, as Scrub
says, those who have been all their lives regularly praised, by regular
critics, like a little variety, and are glad when any one goes out of
his way to say a civil thing; and, fourthly, she is a very good-natured
creature, which is the best reason, after all, and, perhaps, the only
one.</p>

<p>"A knock&mdash;knocks single and double. Bland called. He says Dutch society
(he has been in Holland) is second-hand French; but the women are like
women every where else. This is a bore; I should like to see them a
little unlike; but that can't be expected.</p>

<p>"Went out&mdash;came home&mdash;this, that, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>Pg 298</span> other&mdash;and 'all is vanity,
saith the preacher,' and so say I, as part of his congregation. Talking
of vanity, whose praise do I prefer? Why, Mrs. Inchbald's, and that of
the Americans. The first, because her 'Simple Story' and 'Nature and
Art' are, to me, <i>true</i> to their <i>titles;</i> and, consequently, her short
note to Rogers about 'The Giaour' delighted me more than any thing,
except the Edinburgh Review. I like the Americans, because <i>I</i> happened
to be in <i>Asia</i>, while the English Bards and Scotch Reviewers were redde
in <i>America</i>. If I could have had a speech against the <i>Slave Trade, in
Africa</i>, and an epitaph on a dog in <i>Europe</i> (i.e. in the Morning Post),
my <i>vertex sublimis</i> would certainly have displaced stars enough to
overthrow the Newtonian system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Friday, December 10. 1813.</p>

<p>"I am <i>ennuy&egrave;</i> beyond my usual tense of that yawning verb, which I am
always conjugating; and I don't find that society much mends the matter.
I am too lazy to shoot myself&mdash;and it would annoy Augusta, and perhaps *
*; but it would be a good thing for George, on the other side, and no
bad one for me; but I won't be tempted.</p>

<p>"I have had the kindest letter from M * * e. I <i>do</i> think that man is
the best-hearted, the only <i>hearted</i> being I ever encountered; and,
then, his talents are equal to his feelings.</p>

<p>"Dined on Wednesday at Lord H.'s&mdash;the Staffords, Sta&euml;ls, Cowpers,
Ossulstones, Melbournes, Mackintoshes, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and was introduced to
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>Pg 299</span> Marquis and Marchioness of Stafford,&mdash;an unexpected event. My
quarrel with Lord Carlisle (their or his brother-in-law) having rendered
it improper, I suppose, brought it about. But, if it was to happen at
all, I wonder it did not occur before. She is handsome, and must have
been beautiful&mdash;and her manners are <i>princessly</i>.</p>

<p>"The Sta&euml;l was at the other end of the table, and less loquacious than
heretofore. We are now very good friends; though she asked Lady
Melbourne whether I had really any <i>bonhommie</i>. She might as well have
asked that question before she told C.L. 'c'est un d&eacute;mon." True enough,
but rather premature, for <i>she</i> could not have found it out, and so&mdash;she
wants me to dine there next Sunday.</p>

<p>"Murray prospers, as far as circulation. For my part, I adhere (in
liking) to my Fragment. It is no wonder that I wrote one&mdash;my mind is a
fragment.</p>

<p>"Saw Lord Gower, Tierney, &amp;c. in the square. Took leave of Lord Gr. who
is going to Holland and Germany. He tells me that he carries with him a
parcel of 'Harolds' and 'Giaours,' &amp;c. for the readers of Berlin, who,
it seems, read English, and have taken a caprice for mine. Um!&mdash;have I
been <i>German</i> all this time, when I thought myself <i>Oriental</i>?</p>

<p>"Lent Tierney my box for to-morrow; and received a new comedy sent by
Lady C.A.&mdash;but <i>not hers</i>. I must read it, and endeavour not to
displease the author. I hate annoying them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>Pg 300</span> cavil; but a comedy I
take to be the most difficult of compositions, more so than tragedy.</p>

<p>"G&mdash;&mdash;t says there is a coincidence between the first part of 'The
Bride' and some story of his&mdash;whether published or not, I know not,
never having seen it. He is almost the last person on whom any one would
commit literary larceny, and I am not conscious of any witting thefts on
any of the genus. As to originality, all pretensions are
ludicrous,&mdash;'there is nothing new under the sun.'</p>

<p>"Went last night to the play. Invited out to a party, but did not
go;&mdash;right. Refused to go to Lady * *'s on Monday;&mdash;right again. If I
must fritter away my life, I would rather do it alone. I was much
tempted;&mdash;C * * looked so Turkish with her red Turban, and her regular,
dark, and clear features. Not that <i>she</i> and <i>I</i> ever were, or could be,
any thing; but I love any aspect that reminds me of the 'children of the
sun.'</p>

<p>"To dine to-day with Rogers and Sharpe, for which I have some appetite,
not having tasted food for the preceding forty-eight hours. I wish I
could leave off eating altogether.</p>

<p>"By G&mdash;&mdash;t's answer, I find it is some story in <i>real life</i>, and not any
work with which my late composition coincides. It is still more
singular, for mine is drawn from <i>existence</i> also.</p>

<p>"I have sent an excuse to M. de Sta&euml;l. I do not feel sociable enough for
dinner to-day;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>Pg 301</span> I will not go to Sheridan's on Wednesday. Not that
I do not admire and prefer his unequalled conversation; but&mdash;that
'<i>but</i>' must only be intelligible to thoughts I cannot write. Sheridan
was in good talk at Rogers's the other night, but I only stayed till
<i>nine</i>. All the world are to be at the Sta&euml;l's to-night, and I am not
sorry to escape any part of it. I only go out to get me a fresh appetite
for being alone. Went out&mdash;did not go to the Sta&euml;l's but to Ld.
Holland's. Party numerous&mdash;conversation general. Stayed late&mdash;made a
blunder&mdash;got over it&mdash;came home and went to bed, not having eaten.
Rather empty, but <i>fresco</i>, which is the great point with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Monday, December 13. 1813.</p>

<p>"Called at three places&mdash;read, and got ready to leave town to-morrow.
Murray has had a letter from his brother bibliopole of Edinburgh, who
says, 'he is lucky in having such a <i>poet</i>'&mdash;something as if one was a
pack-horse, or 'ass, or any thing that is his:' or, like Mrs. Packwood,
who replied to some enquiry after the Odes on Razors,&mdash;'Laws, sir, we
keeps a poet.' The same illustrious Edinburgh bookseller once sent an
order for books, poesy, and cookery, with this agreeable
postscript&mdash;'The <i>Harold</i> and <i>Cookery</i> are much wanted.' Such is fame,
and, after all, quite as good as any other 'life in other's breath.'
'Tis much the same to divide purchasers with Hannah Glasse or Hannah
More.</p>

<p>"Some editor of some magazine has <i>announced</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>Pg 302</span> to Murray his intention
of abusing the thing '<i>without reading it</i>.' So much the better; if he
redde it first, he would abuse it more.</p>

<p>"Allen (Lord Holland's Allen&mdash;the best informed and one of the ablest
men I know&mdash;a perfect Magliabecchi&mdash;a devourer, a Helluo of books, and
an observer of men,) has lent me a quantity of Burns's unpublished, and
never-to-be published, Letters. They are full of oaths and obscene
songs. What an antithetical mind!&mdash;tenderness, roughness&mdash;delicacy,
coarseness&mdash;sentiment, sensuality&mdash;soaring and grovelling, dirt and
deity&mdash;all mixed up in that one compound of inspired clay!</p>

<p>"It seems strange; a true voluptuary will never abandon his mind to the
grossness of reality. It is by exalting the earthly, the material, the
<i>physique</i> of our pleasures, by veiling these ideas, by forgetting them
altogether, or, at least, never naming them hardly to one's self, that
we alone can prevent them from disgusting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"December 14, 15, 16.</p>

<p>"Much done, but nothing to record. It is quite enough to set down my
thoughts,&mdash;my actions will rarely bear retrospection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"December 17, 18.</p>

<p>"Lord Holland told me a curious piece of sentimentality in
Sheridan.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The other night we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>Pg 303</span> all delivering our respective
and various opinions on him and other <i>hommes marquans</i>, and mine was
this:&mdash;'Whatever Sheridan has done or chosen to do has been, <i>par
excellence</i>, always the <i>best</i> of its kind. He has written the <i>best</i>
comedy (School for Scandal), the <i>best</i> drama, (in my mind, far before
that St. Giles's lampoon, the Beggar's Opera,) the best farce (the
Critic&mdash;it is only too good for a farce), and the best Address
(Monologue on Garrick), and, to crown all, delivered the very best
Oration (the famous Begum Speech) ever conceived or heard in this
country.' Somebody told S. this the next day, and on hearing it, he
burst into tears!</p>

<p>"Poor Brinsley! if they were tears of pleasure, I would rather have said
these few, but most sincere, words than have written the Iliad or made
his own celebrated Philippic. Nay, his own comedy never gratified me
more than to hear that he had derived a moment's gratification from any
praise of mine, humble as it must appear to 'my elders and my betters.'</p>

<p>"Went to my box at Covent Garden to night; and my delicacy felt a little
shocked at seeing S * * *'s mistress (who, to my certain knowledge, was
actually educated, from her birth, for her profession) sitting with her
mother, 'a three-piled b&mdash;&mdash;d, b&mdash;&mdash;d-Major to the army,' in a private
box opposite. I felt rather indignant; but, casting my eyes round the
house, in the next box to me, and the next, and the next, were the most
distinguished old and young Babylonians of quality;&mdash;so I burst<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>Pg 304</span> out a
laughing. It was really odd; Lady * * <i>divorced</i>&mdash;Lady * * and her
daughter, Lady * *, both <i>divorceable</i>&mdash;Mrs. * *<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, in the next, the
<i>like</i>, and still nearer * * * * * *! What an assemblage to <i>me</i>, who
know all their histories. It was as if the house had been divided
between your public and your <i>understood</i> courtesans;&mdash;but the
intriguantes much outnumbered the regular mercenaries. On the other side
were only Pauline and <i>her</i> mother, and, next box to her, three of
inferior note. Now, where lay the difference between <i>her</i> and <i>mamma</i>,
and Lady * * and daughter? except that the two last may enter Carleton
and any <i>other house</i>, and the two first are limited to the opera and
b&mdash;&mdash;house. How I do delight in observing life as it really is!&mdash;and
myself, after all, the worst of any. But no matter&mdash;I must avoid
egotism, which, just now, would be no vanity.</p>

<p>"I have lately written a wild, rambling, unfinished rhapsody, called
'The Devil's Drive<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>,' the notion of which I took from Porson's
'Devil's Walk.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>Pg 305</span></p>

<p>"Redde some Italian, and wrote two Sonnets on * * *. I never wrote but
one sonnet before, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>Pg 306</span> that was not in earnest, and many years ago, as
an exercise&mdash;and I will never write another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>Pg 307</span> They are the most puling,
petrifying, stupidly platonic compositions. I detest the Petrarch so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>Pg 308</span>
much<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>, that I would not be the man even to have obtained his Laura,
which the metaphysical, whining dotard never could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"January 16. 1814.</p>

<p>"To-morrow I leave town for a few days. I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>Pg 309</span> Lewis to-day, who is just
returned from Oatlands, where he has been squabbling with Mad. de Sta&euml;l
about himself, Clarissa Harlowe, Mackintosh, and me. My homage has never
been paid in that quarter, or we would have agreed still worse. I don't
talk&mdash;I can't flatter, and won't listen, except to a pretty or a foolish
woman. She bored Lewis with praises of himself till he sickened&mdash;found
out that Clarissa was perfection, and Mackintosh the first man in
England. There I agree, at least <i>one</i> of the first&mdash;but Lewis did not.
As to Clarissa, I leave to those who can read it to judge and dispute. I
could not do the one, and am, consequently, not qualified for the other.
She told Lewis wisely, he being my friend, that I was affected, in the
first place; and that, in the next place, I committed the heinous
offence of sitting at dinner with my <i>eyes</i> shut, or half shut. I wonder
if I really have this trick. I must cure myself of it, if true. One
insensibly acquires awkward habits, which should be broken in time. If
this is one, I wish I had been told of it before. It would not so much
signify if one was always to be checkmated by a plain woman, but one may
as well see some of one's neighbours, as well as the plate upon the
table.</p>

<p>"I should like, of all things, to have heard the Amab&aelig;an eclogue between
her and Lewis&mdash;both obstinate, clever, odd, garrulous, and shrill. In
fact, one could have heard nothing else. But they fell out, alas!&mdash;and
now they will never quarrel again. Could not one reconcile them for the
'nonce?'<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>Pg 310</span> Poor Corinne&mdash;she will find that some of her fine sayings
won't suit our fine ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>"I am getting rather into admiration of * *, the youngest sister of * *.
A wife would be my salvation. I am sure the wives of my acquaintances
have hitherto done me little good. * * is beautiful, but very young,
and, I think, a fool. But I have not seen enough to judge; besides, I
hate an <i>esprit</i> in petticoats. That she won't love me is very probable,
nor shall I love her. But, on my system, and the modern system in
general, that don't signify. The business (if it came to business) would
probably be arranged between papa and me. She would have her own way; I
am good-humoured to women, and docile; and, if I did not fall in love
with her, which I should try to prevent, we should be a very comfortable
couple. As to conduct, <i>that</i> she must look to. But <i>if</i> I love, I shall
be jealous;&mdash;and for that reason I will not be in love. Though, after
all, I doubt my temper, and fear I should not be so patient as becomes
the <i>biens&eacute;ance</i> of a married man in my station. Divorce ruins the poor
<i>femme</i>, and damages are a paltry compensation. I do fear my temper
would lead me into some of our oriental tricks of vengeance, or, at any
rate, into a summary appeal to the court of twelve paces. So 'I'll none
on 't,' but e'en remain single and solitary;&mdash;though I should like to
have somebody now and then to yawn with one.</p>

<p>"W. and, after him, * *, has stolen one of my buffooneries about Mde. de
Sta&euml;l's Metaphysics and the Fog, and passed it, by speech and letter,
as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>Pg 311</span> their own. As Gibbet says, 'they are the most of a gentleman of any
on the road.' W. is in sad enmity with the Whigs about this Review of
Fox (if he <i>did</i> review him);&mdash;all the epigrammatists and essayists are
at him. I hate <i>odds</i>, and wish he may beat them. As for me, by the
blessing of indifference, I have simplified my politics into an utter
detestation of all existing governments; and, as it is the shortest and
most agreeable and summary feeling imaginable, the first moment of an
universal republic would convert me into an advocate for single and
uncontradicted despotism. The fact is, riches are power, and poverty is
slavery all over the earth, and one sort of establishment is no better
nor worse for a <i>people</i> than another. I shall adhere to my party,
because it would not be honourable to act otherwise; but, as to
<i>opinions</i>, I don't think politics <i>worth</i> an <i>opinion</i>. <i>Conduct</i> is
another thing:&mdash;if you begin with a party, go on with them. I have no
consistency, except in politics; and <i>that</i> probably arises from my
indifference on the subject altogether."</p>

<p>I must here be permitted to interrupt, for a while, the progress of this
Journal,&mdash;which extends through some months of the succeeding year,&mdash;for
the purpose of noticing, without infringement of chronological order,
such parts of the poet's literary history and correspondence as belong
properly to the date of the year 1813.</p>

<p>At the beginning, as we have seen, of the month<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>Pg 312</span> of December, The Bride
of Abydos was published,&mdash;having been struck off, like its predecessor,
The Giaour, in one of those paroxysms of passion and imagination, which
adventures such as the poet was now engaged in were, in a temperament
like his, calculated to excite. As the mathematician of old required but
a spot to stand upon, to be able, as he boasted, to move the world, so a
certain degree of foundation in <i>fact</i> seemed necessary to Byron, before
that lever which he knew how to apply to the world of the passions could
be wielded by him. So small, however, was, in many instances, the
connection with reality which satisfied him, that to aim at tracing
through his stories these links with his own fate and fortunes, which
were, after all, perhaps, visible but to his own fancy, would be a task
as uncertain as unsafe;&mdash;and this remark applies not only to The Bride
of Abydos, but to The Corsair, Lara, and all the other beautiful
fictions that followed, in which, though the emotions expressed by the
poet may be, in general, regarded as vivid recollections of what had at
different times agitated his own bosom, there are but little
grounds,&mdash;however he might himself, occasionally, encourage such a
supposition,&mdash;for connecting him personally with the groundwork or
incidents of the stories.</p>

<p>While yet uncertain about the fate of his own new poem, the following
observations on the work of an ingenious follower in the same track were
written.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>Pg 313</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 143. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dec. 4. 1813.</p>

<p>"I have redde through your Persian Tales<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, and have taken the
liberty of making some remarks on the <i>blank</i> pages. There are many
beautiful passages, and an interesting story; and I cannot give you
a stronger proof that such is my opinion, than by the <i>date</i> of the
<i>hour</i>&mdash;<i>two o'clock</i>, till which it has kept me awake <i>without a
yawn</i>. The conclusion is not quite correct in <i>costume</i>; there is
no <i>Mussulman suicide</i> on record&mdash;at least for <i>love</i>. But this
matters not. The tale must have been written by some one who has
been on the spot, and I wish him, and he deserves, success. Will
you apologise to the author for the liberties I have taken with his
MS.? Had I been less awake to, and interested in, his theme, I had
been less obtrusive; but you know <i>I</i> always take this in good
part, and I hope he will. It is difficult to say what <i>will</i>
succeed, and still more to pronounce what <i>will not</i>. <i>I</i> am at
this moment in <i>that uncertainty</i> (on our <i>own</i> score); and it is
no small proof of the author's powers to be able to <i>charm</i> and
<i>fix</i> a <i>mind</i>'s attention on similar subjects and climates in such
a predicament. That he may have the same effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>Pg 314</span> upon all his
readers is very sincerely the wish, and hardly the <i>doubt</i>, of
yours truly, B."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To The Bride of Abydos he made additions, in the course of printing,
amounting, altogether, to near two hundred lines; and, as usual, among
the passages thus added, were some of the happiest and most brilliant in
the whole poem. The opening lines,&mdash;"Know ye the land,' &amp;c.&mdash;supposed to
have been suggested to him by a song of Go&euml;the's<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>&mdash;were among the
number of these new insertions, as were also those fine verses,&mdash;"Who
hath not proved how feebly words essay," &amp;c. Of one of the most popular
lines in this latter passage, it is not only curious, but instructive,
to trace the progress to its present state of finish. Having at first
written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mind on her lip and music in her face,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he afterwards altered it to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mind of music breathing in her face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, this not satisfying him, the next step of correction brought the
line to what it is at present&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mind, the music breathing from her face."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><br /></span>
</div></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>Pg 315</span></p>

<p>But the longest, as well as most splendid, of those passages, with which
the perusal of his own strains, during revision, inspired him, was that
rich flow of eloquent feeling which follows the couplet,&mdash;"Thou, my
Zuleika, share and bless my bark," &amp;c.&mdash;a strain of poetry, which, for
energy and tenderness of thought, for music of versification, and
selectness of diction, has, throughout the greater portion of it, but
few rivals in either ancient or modern song. All this passage was sent,
in successive scraps, to the printer,&mdash;correction following correction,
and thought reinforced by thought. We have here, too, another example of
that retouching process by which some of his most exquisite effects were
attained. Every reader remembers the four beautiful lines&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>Pg 316</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or, since that hope denied in worlds of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thou the rainbow to the storms of life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening beam that smiles the clouds away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first copy of this passage sent to the publisher, the last line
was written thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">{<i>an airy</i>}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And tints to-morrow with a {fancied} ray"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the following note being annexed:&mdash;"Mr. Murray,&mdash;Choose which of the two
epithets, 'fancied,' or 'airy,' may be the best; or, if neither will do,
tell me, and I will dream another." The poet's dream was, it must be
owned, lucky,&mdash;"prophetic" being the word, of all others, for his
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>I shall select but one more example, from the additions to this poem, as
a proof that his eagerness and facility in producing, was sometimes
almost equalled by his anxious care in correcting. In the long passage
just referred to, the six lines beginning "Blest as the Muezzin's
strain," &amp;c., having been despatched to the printer too late for
insertion, were, by his desire, added in an errata page; the first
couplet, in its original form, being as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Soft as the Mecca-Muezzin's strains invite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him who hath journey'd far to join the rite."<br /></span>
</div></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>Pg 317</span></p>

<p>In a few hours after, another scrap was sent off, containing the lines
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blest as the Muezzin's strain from Mecca's dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which welcomes Faith to view her Prophet's tomb"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>with the following note to Mr. Murray:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"December 3. 1813.</p>

<p>"Look out in the Encyclopedia, article <i>Mecca</i>, whether it is there
or at <i>Medina</i> the Prophet is entombed. If at Medina, the first
lines of my alterration must run&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Blest as the call which from Medina's dome<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Invites Devotion to her Prophet's tomb," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If at Mecca, the lines may stand as before. Page 45. canto 2d,
Bride of Abydos. Yours, B.</p>

<p>"You will find this out either by article <i>Mecca</i>, <i>Medina</i>, or
<i>Mohammed</i>. I have no book of reference by me."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Immediately after succeeded another note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Did you look out? Is it <i>Medina</i> or <i>Mecca</i> that contains the
<i>Holy</i> Sepulchre? Don't make me blaspheme by your negligence. I
have no book of reference, or I would save you the trouble. I
<i>blush</i>, as a good Mussulman, to have confused the point.</p>

<p>"Yours, B."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Notwithstanding all these various changes, the couplet in question
stands at present thus:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>Pg 318</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blest as the Muezzin's strain from Mecca's wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pilgrims pure and prostrate at his call."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In addition to his own watchfulness over the birth of his new poem, he
also, as will be seen from the following letter, invoked the veteran
taste of Mr. Gifford on the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 144. TO MR. GIFFORD.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"November 12. 1813.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I hope you will consider, when I venture on any request, that it
is the reverse of a certain Dedication, and is addressed, <i>not</i> to
'The Editor of the Quarterly Review,' but to Mr. Gifford. You will
understand this, and on that point I need trouble you no farther.</p>

<p>"You have been good enough to look at a thing of mine in MS.&mdash;a
Turkish story, and I should feel gratified if you would do it the
same favour in its probationary state of printing. It was written,
I cannot say for amusement, nor 'obliged by hunger and request of
friends,' but in a state of mind from circumstances which
occasionally occur to 'us youth,' that rendered it necessary for me
to apply my mind to something, any thing but reality; and under
this not very brilliant inspiration it was composed. Being done,
and having at least diverted me from myself, I thought you would
not perhaps be offended if Mr. Murray forwarded it to you. He has
done so, and to apologise for his doing so a second time is the
object of my present letter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>Pg 319</span></p>

<p>"I beg you will <i>not</i> send me any answer. I assure you very
sincerely I know your time to be occupied, and it is enough, more
than enough, if you read; you are not to be bored with the fatigue
of answers.</p>

<p>"A word to Mr. Murray will be sufficient, and send it either to the
flames or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"A hundred hawkers' load,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On wings of wind to fly or fall abroad.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It deserves no better than the first, as the work of a week, and
scribbled 'stans pede in uno' (by the by, the only foot I have to
stand on); and I promise never to trouble you again under forty
Cantos, and a voyage between each. Believe me ever</p>

<p>"Your obliged and affectionate servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following letters and notes, addressed to Mr. Murray at this time,
cannot fail, I think, to gratify all those to whom the history of the
labours of genius is interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 145. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nov. 12. 1813.</p>

<p>"Two friends of mine (Mr. Rogers and Mr. Sharpe) have advised me
not to risk at present any single publication separately, for
various reasons. As they have not seen the one in question, they
can have no bias for or against the merits (if it has any) or the
faults of the present subject of our conversation. You say all the
last of 'The Giaour' are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>Pg 320</span> gone&mdash;at least out of your hands. Now, if
you think of publishing any new edition with the last additions
which have not yet been before the reader (I mean distinct from the
two-volume publication), we can add 'The Bride of Abydos,' which
will thus steal quietly into the world: if liked, we can then throw
off some copies for the purchasers of former 'Giaours;' and, if
not, I can omit it in any future publication. What think you? I

others, advises a separate publication. On this we can easily
decide. I confess I like the <i>double</i> form better. Hodgson says, it

his "still-breeding thoughts," there yet remain a few more that might be

reputation of the person from whom it proceeded would, in the minds of
most people, have justified him in treating with disregard, but which a
more enlarged feeling of humanity led him to view in a very different
light; for, when expostulated with by Mr. Murray on his generous
intentions towards one "whom nobody else would give a single farthing
to," he answered, "it is for that very reason <i>I</i> give it, because
nobody else will." The person in question was Mr. Thomas Ashe, author of
a certain notorious publication called "The Book," which, from the
delicate mysteries discussed in its pages, attracted far more notice
than its talent, or even mischief, deserved. In a fit, it is to be

poverty as his excuse for the vile uses to which he had hitherto
prostituted his pen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>Pg 335</span> soliciting his Lordship's aid towards enabling
him to exist, in future, more reputably. To this application the
following answer, marked, in the highest degree, by good sense,
humanity, and honourable sentiment, was returned by Lord Byron:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 152. TO MR. ASHE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"4. Bennet Street, St. James's, Dec. 14. 1813.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"I leave town for a few days to-morrow; on my return, I will answer
your letter more at length. Whatever may be your situation, I
cannot but commend your resolution to abjure and abandon the
publication and composition of works such as those to which you
have alluded. Depend upon it they amuse <i>few</i>, disgrace both
<i>reader</i> and <i>writer</i>, and benefit <i>none</i>. It will be my wish to
assist you, as far as my limited means will admit, to break such a
bondage. In your answer, inform me what sum you think would enable
you to extricate yourself from the hands of your employers, and to
regain, at least, temporary independence, and I shall be glad to
contribute my mite towards it. At present, I must conclude. Your
name is not unknown to me, and I regret, for your own sake, that
you have ever lent it to the works you mention. In saying this, I
merely repeat your <i>own words</i> in your letter to me, and have no
wish whatever to say a single syllable that may appear to insult
your misfortunes. If I have, excuse me; it is unintentional. Yours,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In answer to this letter, Ashe mentioned, as the sum necessary to
extricate him from his difficulties, 150<i>l</i>.&mdash;to be advanced at the rate
of ten pounds per month; and, some short delay having occurred in the
reply to this demand, the modest applicant, in renewing his suit,
complained, it appears, of neglect: on which Lord Byron, with a good
temper which few, in a similar case, could imitate, answered him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 153. TO MR. ASHE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"January 5. 1814.</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"When you accuse a stranger of neglect, you forget that it is
possible business or absence from London may have interfered to
delay his answer, as has actually occurred in the present instance.
But to the point. I am willing to do what I can to extricate you
from your situation. Your first scheme<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I was considering; but
your own impatience appears to have rendered it abortive, if not
irretrievable. I will deposit in Mr. Murray's hands (with his
consent) the sum you mentioned, to be advanced for the time at ten
pounds per month.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I write in the greatest hurry, which may make my letter a
little abrupt; but, as I said before, I have no wish to distress
your feelings."</p></div>

<p>The service thus humanely proffered was no less punctually performed;
and the following is one of the many acknowledgments of payment which I
find in Ashe's letters to Mr. Murray:&mdash;"I have the honour to enclose you
another memorandum for the sum of ten pounds, in compliance with the
munificent instructions of Lord Byron."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>His friend, Mr. Merivale, one of the translators of those Selections
from the Anthology which we have seen he regretted so much not having
taken with him on his travels, published a poem about this time, which
he thus honours with his praise.</p>

so disposed) see very little room for criticism. There is a choice
of two lines in one of the last Cantos,&mdash;I think 'Live and protect'

inclination. I would allow the&mdash;but that point you yourself must
determine on&mdash;I mean the doubt as to where to place a part of the
Poem, whether between the actions or no. Only if you wish to have
all the success you de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>Pg 338</span>serve, <i>never listen to friends</i>, and&mdash;as I

<p>"I hope you will be out soon. <i>March</i>, sir, <i>March</i> is the month
for the <i>trade</i>, and they must be considered. You have written a
very noble Poem, and nothing but the detestable taste of the day

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the extracts from his Journal, just given, there is a passage that
cannot fail to have been remarked, where, in speaking of his admiration
of some lady, whose name he has himself left blank, the noble writer
says&mdash;"a wife would be the salvation of me." It was under this
conviction, which not only himself but some of his friends entertained,
of the prudence of his taking timely refuge in matrimony from those
perplexities which form the sequel of all less regular ties, that he had
been induced, about a year before, to turn his thoughts seriously to
marriage,&mdash;at least, as seriously as his thoughts were ever capable of
being so turned,&mdash;and chiefly, I believe, by the advice and intervention
of his friend Lady Melbourne, to become a suitor for the hand of a
relative of that lady, Miss Milbanke. Though his proposal was not then
accepted, every assurance of friendship and regard accompanied the
refusal; a wish was even expressed that they should continue to write to
each other, and a correspondence, in consequence,&mdash;somewhat sin<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>Pg 339</span>gular
between two young persons of different sexes, inasmuch as love was not
the subject of it,&mdash;ensued between them. We have seen how highly Lord
Byron estimated as well the virtues as the accomplishments of the young
lady; but it is evident that on neither side, at this period, was love
either felt or professed.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, new entanglements, in which his heart was the willing
dupe of his fancy and vanity, came to engross the young poet: and still,
as the usual penalties of such pursuits followed, he again found himself
sighing for the sober yoke of wedlock, as some security against their
recurrence. There were, indeed, in the interval between Miss Milbanke's
refusal and acceptance of him, two or three other young women of rank
who, at different times, formed the subject of his matrimonial dreams.
In the society of one of these, whose family had long honoured me with
their friendship, he and I passed much of our time, during this and the
preceding spring; and it will be found that, in a subsequent part of his
correspondence, he represents me as having entertained an anxious wish
that he should so far cultivate my fair friend's favour as to give a
chance, at least, of matrimony being the result.</p>

<p>That I, more than once, expressed some such feeling is undoubtedly true.
Fully concurring with the opinion, not only of himself, but of others of
his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>Pg 340</span> friends, that in marriage lay his only chance of salvation from the
sort of perplexing attachments into which he was now constantly tempted,
I saw in none of those whom he admired with more legitimate views so
many requisites for the difficult task of winning him into fidelity and
happiness as in the lady in question. Combining beauty of the highest
order with a mind intelligent and ingenuous,&mdash;having just learning
enough to give refinement to her taste, and far too much taste to make
pretensions to learning,&mdash;with a patrician spirit proud as his own, but
showing it only in a delicate generosity of spirit, a feminine
high-mindedness, which would have led her to tolerate his defects in
consideration of his noble qualities and his glory, and even to
sacrifice silently some of her own happiness rather than violate the
responsibility in which she stood pledged to the world for his;&mdash;such
was, from long experience, my impression of the character of this lady;
and perceiving Lord Byron to be attracted by her more obvious claims to
admiration, I felt a pleasure no less in rendering justice to the still
rarer qualities which she possessed, than in endeavouring to raise my
noble friend's mind to the contemplation of a higher model of female
character than he had, unluckily for himself, been much in the habit of
studying.</p>

<p>To this extent do I confess myself to have been influenced by the sort
of feeling which he attributes to me. But in taking for granted (as it
will appear he did from one of his letters) that I entertained any very
decided or definite wishes on the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>Pg 341</span> he gave me more credit for
seriousness in my suggestions than I deserved. If even the lady herself,
the unconscious object of these speculations, by whom he was regarded in
no other light than that of a distinguished acquaintance, could have
consented to undertake the perilous,&mdash;but still possible and
glorious,&mdash;achievement of attaching Byron to virtue, I own that,
sanguinely as, in theory, I might have looked to the result, I should
have seen, not without trembling, the happiness of one whom I had known
and valued from her childhood risked in the experiment.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to resume the thread of the Journal, which I had
broken off, and of which, it will be perceived, the noble author himself
had, for some weeks, at this time, interrupted the progress.</p>

Alfieri, before his dramatic genius had yet unfolded itself, used to
pass hours, as he tells us, in this sort of dreaming state, gazing upon
the ocean:&mdash;"Apr&egrave;s le spectacle un de mes amusemens, &agrave; Marseille, &eacute;tait
de me baigner presque tous les soirs dans la mer. J'avais trouv&eacute; un
petit endroit fort agr&eacute;able, sur une langue de terre plac&eacute;e &agrave; droite

n'avais plus devant moi que le ciel et la mer. Entre ces deux immensit&eacute;s
qu'embellissaient les rayons d'un soleil couchant, je passai en r&ecirc;vant
des heures d&eacute;licieuses; et l&agrave;, je serais devenu po&euml;te, si j'avais su

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> But a few months before he died, in a conversation with
Maurocordato at Missolonghi, Lord Byron said&mdash;"The Turkish History was
one of the first books that gave me pleasure when a child; and I believe
it had much influence on my subsequent wishes to visit the Levant, and
gave perhaps the oriental colouring which is observed in my
poetry."&mdash;COUNT GAMBA's <i>Narrative</i>.
</p><p>
In the last edition of Mr. D'Israeli's work on "the Literary Character,"
that gentleman has given some curious marginal notes, which he found
written by Lord Byron in a copy of this work that belonged to him. Among
them is the following enumeration of the writers that, besides Rycaut,
had drawn his attention so early to the East:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Knolles, Cantemir, De Tott, Lady M.W. Montague, Hawkins's Translation
from Mignot's History of the Turks, the Arabian Nights, all travels, or
histories, or books upon the East I could meet with, I had read, as well
as Rycaut, before I was <i>ten years old</i>. I think the Arabian Nights
first. After these, I preferred the history of naval actions, Don
Quixote, and Smollett's novels, particularly Roderick Random, and I was
passionate for the Roman History. When a boy, I could never bear to read
any Poetry whatever without disgust and reluctance."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "It rained hard the next day, and we spent another evening
with our soldiers. The captain, Elmas, tried a fine Manton gun belonging
to my Friend, and hitting his mark every time was highly
delighted."&mdash;HOBHOUSE'<i>s</i> <i>Journey</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It must be recollected that by two of these gentlemen he
was seen chiefly under the restraints of presentation and etiquette,
when whatever gloom there was on his spirits would, in a shy nature like
his, most show itself. The account which his fellow-traveller gives of
him is altogether different. In introducing the narration of a short
tour to Negroponte, in which his noble friend was unable to accompany
him, Mr. Hobhouse expresses strongly the deficiency of which he is
sensible, from the absence, on this occasion, of "a companion, who, to
quickness of observation and ingenuity of remark, united that gay
good-humour which keeps alive the attention under the pressure of
fatigue, and softens the aspect of every difficulty and danger." In some
lines, too, of the "Hints from Horace," addressed evidently to Mr.
Hobhouse, Lord Byron not only renders the same justice to his own social
cheerfulness, but gives a somewhat more distinct idea of the frame of
mind out of which it rose;&mdash;

misjudge their productions, when whole generations have sometimes fallen
into the same sort of error. The Sonnets of Petrarch were, by the
learned of his day, considered only worthy of the ballad-singers by whom
they were chanted about the streets; while his Epic Poem, "Africa," of
which few now even know the existence, was sought for on all sides, and
the smallest fragment of it begged from the author, for the libraries of
the learned.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Gray, under the influence of a similar predilection,
preferred, for a long time, his Latin poems to those by which he has
gained such a station in English literature. "Shall we attribute this,"
says Mason, "to his having been educated at Eton, or to what other
cause? Certain it is, that when I first knew him, he seemed to set a
greater value on his Latin poetry than on that which he had composed in
his native language."</p></div>

shoemakers, and been accessary to the poetical undoing of many of the
industrious poor. Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set
all Somersetshire singing. Nor has the malady confined itself to one
county. Pratt, too (who once was wiser), has caught the contagion of
patronage, and decoyed a poor fellow, named Blackett, into poetry; but
he died during the operation, leaving one child and two volumes of
'Remains' utterly destitute. The girl, if she don't take a poetical
twist, and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho, may do well, but the
'Tragedies' are as rickety as if they had been the offspring of an Earl
or a Seatonian prize-poet. The patrons of this poor lad are certainly
answerable for his end, and it ought to be an indictable offence. But
this is the least they have done; for, by a refinement of barbarity,
they have made the (late) man posthumously ridiculous, by printing what
he would have had sense enough never to print himself. Certes, these
rakers of 'Remains' come under the statute against resurrection-men.
What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in
Surgeons' or in Stationers' Hall? is it so bad to unearth his bones as
his blunders? is it not better to gibbet his body on a heath than his
soul in an octavo? 'We know what we are, but we know not what we may
be,' and it is to be hoped we never shall know, if a man who has passed
through life with a sort of &eacute;clat is to find himself a mountebank on the
other side of Styx, and made, like poor Joe Blackett, the laughing-stock
of purgatory. The plea of publication is to provide for the child. Now,
might not some of this 'sutor ultra crepidam's' friends and seducers
have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography? And
then, his inscriptions split into so many modicums! 'To the Duchess of
So Much, the Right Honble. So-and-so, and Mrs. and Miss Somebody, these
volumes are,' &amp;c. &amp;c. Why, this is doling out the 'soft milk of
dedication' in gills; there is but a quart, and he divides it among a
dozen. Why, Pratt! hadst thou not a puff left? dost thou think six
families of distinction can share this in quiet? There is a child, a
book, and a dedication: send the girl to her grace, the volumes to the
grocer, and the dedication to the d-v-l."</p></div>

from the following passage in one of his journals: "Like Sylla, I have
always believed that all things depend upon fortune, and nothing upon
ourselves. I am not aware of any one thought or action worthy of being
called good to myself or others, which is not to be attributed to the

</p><p>
"A literary friend of mine walking out one lovely evening last summer on
the eleventh bridge of the Paddington Canal, was alarmed by the cry of
'One in jeopardy!' He rushed along, collected a body of Irish haymakers
(supping on buttermilk in an adjoining paddock), procured three rakes,
one eel spear, and a landing-net, and at last (<i>horresco referens</i>)
pulled out&mdash;his own publisher. The unfortunate man was gone for ever,
and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap, which proved,
on enquiry, to have been Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;'s last work. Its 'alacrity of
sinking' was so great, that it has never since been heard of, though
some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch's
pastry-premises, Cornhill. Be this as it may, the coroner's inquest
brought in a verdict of 'Felo de Bibliopol&acirc;' against a 'quarto unknown,'
and circumstantial evidence being since strong against the 'Curse of
Kehama' (of which the above words are an exact description), it will be
tried by its peers next session in Grub Street. Arthur, Alfred,
Davideis, Richard Coeur de Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary,
Fall of Cambria, Siege of Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great,
are the names of the twelve jurors. The judges are Pye, * * *, and the
bellman of St. Sepulchre's."</p></div>

shutting the door of the vis-&agrave;-vis, "Have you put in the pistols?" and

accompanied on the occasion by his old schoolfellows, Mr. Bailey and Mr.
John Madocks. They went together from some assembly, and, on their
arriving at the spot, about three o'clock in the morning, not finding
the house that was to receive them open, Mr. Madocks undertook to rouse
the inmates, while Lord Byron and Mr. Bailey sauntered, arm in arm, up
the street. During this interval, rather a painful scene occurred.
Seeing an unfortunate woman lying on the steps of a door, Lord Byron,
with some expression of compassion, offered her a few shillings: but,
instead of accepting them, she violently pushed away his hand, and,
starting up with a yell of laughter, began to mimic the lameness of his
gait. He did not utter a word; but "I could feel," said Mr. Bailey, "his
arm trembling within mine, as we left her."

I may take this opportunity of mentioning another anecdote connected

Rogers, as they were on their way to their carriage, one of the
link-boys ran on before Lord Byron, crying, "This way, my Lord."&mdash;"He
seems to know you," said Mr. Rogers.&mdash;"Know me!" answered Lord Byron,

himself than delightful to us. It was in the course of this evening

sent in, among the other addresses for the opening of Drury Lane

residing on the mountain of Samen in that country. I have had the
honour," he adds, "of some correspondence with the Rev. Dr. Buchanan and
the reverend and learned G.S. Faber, on the subject of the existence of
this kingdom of Jews, which, if it prove to be a fact, will more clearly
elucidate many of the Scripture prophecies; ... and, if Providence
favours your Lordship's mission to Abyssinia, an intercourse might be
established between England and that country, and the English ships,
according to the Rev. Mr. Faber, might be the principal means of
transporting the kingdom of Jews, now in Abyssinia, to Egypt, in the way

to the above letter, I added, "All I ask of your friendship is&mdash;not that
you will abstain from Peris on my account, for that is too much to ask
of human (or, at least, author's) nature&mdash;but that, whenever you mean to
pay your addresses to any of these a&euml;rial ladies, you will, at once,
tell me so, frankly and instantly, and let me, at least, have my choice

Rookh, which I had begun, but, from various causes, never finished,
there was one which I had made some progress in, at the time of the
appearance of "The Bride," and which, on reading that poem, I found to
contain such singular coincidences with it, not only in locality and
costume, but in plot and characters, that I immediately gave up my story
altogether, and began another on an entirely new subject, the
Fire-worshippers. To this circumstance, which I immediately communicated
to him, Lord Byron alludes in this letter. In my hero (to whom I had
even given the name of "Zelim," and who was a descendant of Ali,
outlawed, with all his followers, by the reigning Caliph) it was my
intention to shadow out, as I did afterwards in another form, the
national cause of Ireland. To quote the words of my letter to Lord Byron
on the subject:&mdash;"I chose this story because one writes best about what
one feels most, and I thought the parallel with Ireland would enable me
to infuse some vigour into my hero's character. But to aim at vigour and
strong feeling after <i>you</i> is hopeless;&mdash;that region 'was made for

found upon such resemblances a general charge of plagiarism, we may
apply what Sir Walter Scott says, in that most agreeable work, his Lives

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
